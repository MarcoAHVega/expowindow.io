<!-- 
& 37. File Structure & Navbar

? (37.1) create a project folder  
   
   ? hotel_website
   
   
   ? create first of all a folder for our images (img)
   
  
? (37.2) create our page structure
   So next thing we'll do is create our page structure as you can see we have three pages home about in contact. Now remember in the beginning of the H Tim L. basics section I said that when you have a home page of a Web site you need to call it index dot each team out because when you go to something whatever dot com it's going to look for that file as the home page. So let's say 
   ? index.html (home)
   as a new new file i click to this icon and we might as well create the rest of the team all pages so we'll do each team 
   ? about.html 
   let's do 
   ? contact.html 
   We're also going to need our CSX our style sheet and we're not going to be putting our our CSX in the H team out like we did in the sandbox. I only did that for convenience when you have a project you want to create separate style sheets and generally you want a separate folder that contains those. So I'm going to click this folder icon and 
? (37.3) create a folder called css 
   OK. And then inside there I'm going to create a new file called 
   ? style.css 
   and the named style isn't it doesn't matter what you call this but style main dot CSX. These are common conventions for main style sheets but it doesn't it doesn't really matter. OK. 
   
   * So now that we have that that's basically are our Web site structure. 

? (37.4) let's generate our head body tags inside index.html (boilerplate)
   ^
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
      <title>Document</title>
   </head>
   <body>
      
   </body>
   </html>

?(37.5) head tag 

   ? change the title here to let's say hotel BT 
   ^
   <title>Hotel BT | Welcome</title>
   
   ? meta tags 
   in here like description. I'm not going to do this for every project we create but I'll do it for this one just because it's the first. So let's say Name 
   
   ? Description 
   ^
   <meta name="description" content="Welcome to the most extraordinary hotel in Boston Massachusetts">
   
   ? keywords
   ^
   <meta name="keywords" content="hotel,boston hotel,new england hotel"> 
   
   ? link our style sheet 
   ^
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
    
? (37.6) body tag
   * Now it's important to mention that everyone has their own style. Everyone has their own naming conventions and how they want to structure tags. 
   
? (37.7) header tag 
   *inside my head or I want the navigation and the showcase I want this whole area to be the header 
   ^
   <header>
   
   </header>

? (37.8) the nav tag
   ^
   <nav id="navbar">
   
   ? the logo.
   ^ 
   <h1 class="logo"><a href="index.html">HBT</a></h1> 
   
   ? our navigation which is unordered list. 
   ^
   <ul>
      <li><a class="current" href="index.html">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>
   </ul> 
   
? (37.9) we're going to jump to the CSS 
   * we're going to do and go by basically component by component. 

   * And in addition to the now bar styling I want to do just some of the core basic styling like the body tag and stuff like that. 

? (37.10) add a css reset
   ^
   /* Reset */
   * {
   margin: 0;
   padding:0;
   box-sizing: border-box;
   }

? (37.11) main styling (global css)

? (37.12) So for the body 
   ^
   /* Main Styling */
   html,body {
   font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
   line-height: 1.7em;
   }

? (37.13) all the links (a tags)
   ^
   a {
   color: #333;
   text-decoration: none;
   } 
   
? (37.14) Also the headings (h1, h2, h3)
   * I want spacing underneath. 
   ^
   h1, h2, h3 {
      padding-bottom: 20px;
   } 
   
? (37.15) And then four paragraphs 
   * So I'm just going to re add 10 pixel margin on the top and bottom. OK. 
   ^
   p {
      margin: 10px 0;
   }
   
   * So those are the those are the core styles. 


? (37.16) the actual nav bar
   /* Navbar */
   #navbar {
      background: #333;
      color: #fff;
      overflow: auto;
   } 
   ? an overflow auto 
   * so that the background shows no matter 
   
? (37.17) add the color specifically to those links (logo and links)
   * if you have links you have to add the color specifically to those links. 
   ^
   #navbar a {
      color: #fff;
   } 

? (37.18) add some floats align the logo to the left and the ul to the right

   ? logo float and padding
   ^
   #navbar h1 {
      float: left;
      padding-top: 20px;
   } 
   
   ? float the ul to the right and remove the bullets
   ^
   #navbar ul {
      list-style: none;
      float: right;
   }
     
   ? we want list items to go horizontal
   ^
   #navbar ul li {
      float: left;
   }
   
   ? And then everything else that we style as far as these links is good it's going to be on the a tag inside.
   ^
   #navbar ul li a {
      display: block; // so we can add padding
      padding: 20px;
      text-align: center;
   } 
   
   Now I do want to have a hover state right now if I hover over them nothing happens. So what we can do is take this and just add our pseudo selector of hover so Cole and hover and I'm gonna say background. Let's do four four four and let's also make that color a hexadecimal of f.. Let's do F seven see 0 8 a which is this light brownish tarnished color. So now if I hover over it looks like that. Now one other thing I want to do is depending on the page or on I wanted to have that effect as well if we looked at look at the final project you can see that the home page has that effect. So what we can do is whatever page you're on in the nav bar here we can add a special class and we're going to add it to the link to the tags. So center on the home page here. Let's say class equals and let's call this current OK so we'll go back and then I wanted to have the same styling there's no sense in recreating it let's just put a comma so that it affects both and we'll grab this and then just add the class of current. OK. And you usually want to put this on a new line just to keep it clean and save. And now notice the home page has that. Now before we move on I just want to show you one thing if we stretch us cell really far it's always on the very edge here and I don't want that usually what you'll do is you'll have a container and move it into the middle. OK. And we don't want to wrap a container around everything because then the black bar will actually get mad added you know push to the middle. I want the black bar to go all the way across but I want this stuff to be in the middle so to do that. What we'll do is add a container class within the NAV because remember the NAV the I.D. nav bars is where that background is. So within that we want to have a container class and we want to remove the H1 and the well into that class and save. And then we'll style it. So let's add the container. I'm actually going to put the container up top because it's kind of a utility class meaning you can use it all around. So let's put a comment here and say we'll just say utilities or utility classes and do container. So remember margin auto. Want to do that. That's going to push it all to the middle. But we need to have some kind of width. So for the width we want to use Macs with because we want it to be somewhat responsive as responsive as we can make it without going into stuff. We haven't talked about yet like media queries and we're gonna set that to eleven hundred pixels. That'll be the max with. All right. And then let's see. Let's add in overflow auto just so it always shows the the background doesn't go outside of it. And then some padding. I want to do padding. Let's do zero top and bottom and I just want left and right to have 20 pixels padding. So let's save that. And notice that now it's not right up against the edge. And if I bring this if I bring the browser out it's right when it hits eleven hundred pixels it stops. Okay. That's the max width and yet the black bars still goes all the way across. Now I just want to show you something. You guys don't have to do this. But if we had the container on the outside of the nav bar. OK. So have that and then the div the ending can div for the container outside of the nav bar and save. Now the background doesn't reach all the way across because it's restricted inside the container. OK. And I don't like the way that that looks I'm Web sites from like you know the like the early 2000s looked like that where everything was in this this container and then you had some like funky background over here. Nowadays you want your backgrounds to extend all the way across and you want to just put your content inside containers. OK. And that's another reason why it's a class and not an idea is because we're going to be using this container class throughout the throughout the site. All right so let's just bring that back how it was that was and there we go. OK. So that's it. That's our now bar. So in the next video we're going to start on the showcase area right here.
