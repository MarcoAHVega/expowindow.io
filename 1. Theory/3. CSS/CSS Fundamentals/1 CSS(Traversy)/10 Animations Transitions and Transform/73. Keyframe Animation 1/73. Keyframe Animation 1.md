_there's a few ways to do animations_...

you have key frames which you're going to be looking at

Now we also have transitions

Basically when you animate something and CSS what it means is you're taking a property that can be animated such as a width, a position, a color, opacity, something like that where you have basically you have midpoint.

_(73.1) So let's get started with keyframes_...

- we have a white box it's 200 pixels wide and 200 pixels high.

Now what I want to do is let's and

_(73.2) let's animate the width_...

- First of all, so when it comes to animation we have a bunch of _different properties_ and then we also can combine them much like we can with many other properties like border background stuff like that but

let's look at each one one by one.

So first I'm going to do...

_animation-name:_

and I'm going to call this intimate let's do _animate1_

and let's do...

_animation-duration:_

this is the time that it should take to animate. I'm going to say two seconds...

```
.box {
background: white;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
animation-name: animate1;
animation-duration: 2s;
}
```

_(73.3) We have to create a keyframe_ called _inmate1_...

So we're going to go down below and we're gonna say...

_@keyframes animate1 {}_

_(73.4) so we can basically specify points in the animation_

- The simplest way, from and to...

So we'll say...

_from {}_  
So from we could say like so let's extend the width. So if we could say from with 200 picks

and then...

_to {}_  
set width let's say 600 pix and let's save...

```
.box {
background: white;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
animation-name: animate1;
animation-duration: 2s;
}

@keyframes animate1 {
from {
   width: 200px;
}

to {
   width: 600px;
}
}
```

So you can see that we get that little animation

- now since it's 200 pix to begin with. We don't even need the from like we could simply say to with 600 picks

and if I save it still it still works.

Now there's some other things that we can add here. And by the way if

- you want to change the duration to five seconds now it's going to take five seconds for that to happen for it to extend to 600 pixels.

We're going to change it back to 2.

Notice how it only goes once. What we could do is add in...

_(73.5) animation-iteration-count:_

and to right now it's set to 1.

But let's set it to 2 and let's save and see what happens...

```
.box {
background: white;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
animation-name: animate1;
animation-duration: 2s;
animation-iteration-count: 2;
}

@keyframes animate1 {
from {
   width: 200px;
}

to {
   width: 600px;
}
}
```

- So we get 1 2 and then stops. OK

Now if you wanted to keep going you can use...

_animation-iteration-count: infinite;_

So I'll save and it'll just keep going

_(73.6) animation-fill-mode: forwards;_...

Now I'm going to set this back to 1 which is the default. And I'm going to add another property here called animation-fill-mode:

- So right now notice that once it's done animating once it's done stretching out it goes back to the to its default of two hundred pixels right.

- So what if we want to keep it at that stretched out six hundred pixels.

We can change this to forwards OK so if we save this...

```
.box {
background: white;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
animation-name: animate1;
animation-duration: 2s;
animation-iteration-count: 1;
animation-fill-mode: forwards;
}

@keyframes animate1 {
from {
   width: 200px;
}

to {
   width: 600px;
}
}
```

_now it's going to anime and it's going to stay where it's at_.

Let's see we also have some more properties, we have...

_animation-delay:_

which shall set to two seconds...

```
.box {
background: white;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
animation-name: animate1;
animation-duration: 2s;
animation-iteration-count: 1;
animation-fill-mode: forwards;
animation-delay: 2s;
}

@keyframes animate1 {
from {
   width: 200px;
}

to {
   width: 600px;
}
}
```

So now once they save it's going to wait two seconds and then it's going to start OK.

So it's going to delay the start of the animation.

_(73.7) animation-direction: alternate-reverse;_...

We also have animation-direction:

and let's set that to alternate-reverse;...

```
.box {
background: white;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
animation-name: animate1;
animation-duration: 2s;
animation-iteration-count: 1;
animation-fill-mode: forwards;
animation-delay: 2s;
animation-direction: alternate-reverse;
}

@keyframes animate1 {
from {
   width: 200px;
}

to {
   width: 600px;
}
}
```

So if we save that then it's going to go reverse so you can do that as well. We're going to keep it our alternate.

_(73.8) animation-timing-function: ease;_...

And then the last one I'm going to show you is the timing function

so animation dash timing dash function.

And this is basically like the the motion and you could do like..

_ease_

_ease-in_

which is going to kind of start off and start off fast. And then like ease in or...

_ease-out_

which will start off slow and then go faster.

So let's look at ease in there's not too much of a difference at least in my opinion.

Let's make the let's make the duration a little longer we'll say five seconds and let's watch the motion near it's going to delay. So it starts off slow and then it starts to go faster. All right

let's let's actually comment out the delay but let's do ease. Oh and see the difference. So save and so it starts fast and then it slows down and then you can also do

_ease-in-out_

ease-in-out which will start off slow and end slow...

```
.box {
background: white;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
animation-name: animate1;
animation-duration: 2s;
animation-iteration-count: 2;
animation-fill-mode: forwards;
<!-- animation-delay: 2s; -->
animation-direction: alternate;
animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}

@keyframes animate1 {
from {
   width: 200px;
}

to {
   width: 600px;
}
}
```

And then it eases in all right those are the different timing functions that you can use

_(73.9) animate the background-color_...

now obviously width isn't the only thing we can animate

So we want background color and let's set that to red and we'll go ahead and save...

```
.box {
background: white;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
animation-name: animate1;
animation-duration: 2s;
animation-iteration-count: 2;
animation-fill-mode: forwards;
<!-- animation-delay: 2s; -->
animation-direction: alternate;
animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}

@keyframes animate1 {
from {
   width: 200px;
}

to {
   width: 600px;
   background-color: red;
}
}
```

Now not only is it going to extend to 600 pixels but it's going to turn to red. It's going to go through all the color the whole color system and it's going to go from white to red.

_(73.10) animate the position_...

Let's see another thing we could do is it's position

so let's actually let's give this a position of relative. Because remember when

_we add position relative_

we can use parameters like top bottom left right.

So what I'll do is say

_from top zero_

So basically its default position and then two we're gonna end up at let's say from the top we want to go down three hundred pixels

_to top 600px_

So let's save and...

```
.box {
background: white;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
position: relative;
animation-name: animate1;
animation-duration: 2s;
animation-iteration-count: 2;
animation-fill-mode: forwards;
<!-- animation-delay: 2s; -->
animation-direction: alternate;
animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
}

@keyframes animate1 {
from {
   width: 200px;
   top: 0;
}

to {
   width: 600px;
   background-color: red;
   top: 300px;
}
}
```

now you can see that it's animating the width the color and also the position moving it from from 0 from the top down to 300 pixels from the top.

_(73.11) short hand animation property_...

Now like I said there's a shortcut for this

so you don't have to have all of these different properties we can simply use the animation property

So I'm going to uncommon the delay and I'm going to comment all of these out

and I'm going to show you how we can do this with just one line or just one property.

So going to say...

animation:

_first parameter here is going to be the name of the animation_...

So animate1

_second is going to be the speed or the the the duration_...

So we'll say five seconds.

_Next is going to be the fill mode_...

So I wanted to stop at the end so we'll do forwards

_if we wanted to delay we could do that_...

We'll do a one second delay

_and then we can do the timing function_...

so I'll do ease in out.

OK so let's save that...

```
.box {
background: white;
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
position: relative;
/*animation-name: animate1; */
/*animation-duration: 2s; */
/*animation-iteration-count: 2; */
/*animation-fill-mode: forwards; */
/*animation-direction: alternate; */
/*animation-timing-function: ease-in-out; */

animation: animate1 5s forward 1s ease-in-out;
}

@keyframes animate1 {
from {
   width: 200px;
   top: 0;
}

to {
   width: 600px;
   background-color: red;
   top: 300px;
}
}
```

- Wait a second and then it does the same thing. OK. So this is just a shorter way to do all this stuff.

So that's it in the next video. We're going to we're going to still look at key frames but I want to show you how we can add different points. We don't have to do just from and to we can actually use percentages in here and we're going to make an element move around the screen a little bit different points. All right. So I'll see you in the next video.
