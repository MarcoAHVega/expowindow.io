--------------------------------------

*(76.1) transform: rotate();*...

So we'll go to the box here and let's say transform and then we're gonna have an effect let's use rotate  
 
OK so we'll say rotate and that's going to take in whatever the amount you want to rotate let's say 25deg So 25 degrees and we'll save...

```
body {
   background: #333;
   display: flex;
   align-items: center;
   justify-content: center;
   height: 100vh;
}

.box {
   background: white;
   width: 300px;
   height: 300px;
   transform: rotate(25deg);
}  
```  
 
And that's going to rotate it. 

* Now of course you could rotate this with animation, with key frames, transitions.   
 
* But if you just wanted to have something tilted a little bit you could just use it directly like this.  

*(76.2) transform: skew();*...  
 
let's let's comment this.  
 
So next we're going to look at skew(); which we'll just kind of skew it diagonally. And let's try that...

```
body {
   background: #333;
   display: flex;
   align-items: center;
   justify-content: center;
   height: 100vh;
}

.box {
   background: white;
   width: 300px;
   height: 300px;
   /* transform: rotate(25deg); */
   transform: skew(25deg);
}  
``` 
 
So you can see what skew(); does.  

* And this is nice if you want to have diagonal lines like in your layout  
* if you want to have maybe you know a little showcase area where you have something on this side something on this side and you want to diagonal line in the middle instead of just having it half and half like that.

*(76.3) transform: scale(2);*...

let's look at scale. So scale let's just put in two...

```
body {
   background: #333;
   display: flex;
   align-items: center;
   justify-content: center;
   height: 100vh;
}

.box {
   background: white;
   width: 300px;
   height: 300px;
   /* transform: rotate(25deg); */
   /* transform: skew(25deg); */
   transform: scale(2);
}  
```  
 
* and that's just going to scale it up. So essentially we're doubling in size we could put three and we'll scale even more. All right.  
 
So it's comment that out, now the next thing I want to show you is is

*(76.4) use transform: rotate(); with transitions*...
 
So I'm going to add a transition for all elements that are animateble  
 
and let's do one second is an out OK. (transition: all 1s ease-in-out;)  
 
And then let's just save that.  
 
That's going to go back down and in our hover. Let's let's do the rotate so to rotate instead of 25 though let's do 180...

```
body {
   background: #333;
   display: flex;
   align-items: center;
   justify-content: center;
   height: 100vh;
}

.box {
   background: white;
   width: 300px;
   height: 300px;
   /* transform: rotate(25deg); */
   /* transform: skew(25deg); */
   /* transform: scale(2); */
   transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
}

.box:hover {
   transform: rotate(180deg);
   }  
```  
 
* So now when I hover over it it rotates when I hover off it goes back. So pretty cool.

*(76.5) use transform: skew(); with transitions*...
 
We can also skew it. Let's grab that...

```
body {
   background: #333;
   display: flex;
   align-items: center;
   justify-content: center;
   height: 100vh;
}

.box {
   background: white;
   width: 300px;
   height: 300px;
   /* transform: rotate(25deg); */
   /* transform: skew(25deg); */
   /* transform: scale(2); */
   transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
}

.box:hover {
   transform: rotate(180deg);
   transform: skew(25deg);
}  
```  
 
* so now when I hover over it it skews   
 
* and this this is going to basically you know overwrite the rotate

*(76.6) use transform: scale(); with transitions*...

and then we can also do scale so we save that...

```
body {
   background: #333;
   display: flex;
   align-items: center;
   justify-content: center;
   height: 100vh;
}

.box {
   background: white;
   width: 300px;
   height: 300px;
   /* transform: rotate(25deg); */
   /* transform: skew(25deg); */
   /* transform: scale(2); */
   transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
}

.box:hover {
   transform: rotate(180deg);
   transform: skew(25deg);
   transform: scale(2);
}  
```  
 
* and I hover over it. It'll scale up.

*(76.7) use transform: translateY();*...
 
* Now we can also move this around the page without having to do like a position relative and then doing top bottom left right properties.  
 
* And we can do that by using translate we have translate we have translate X translate y so we can move it along the x axis in the y axis.  
 
So let's actually comment this stuff out and let's do a trance form and then we're gonna set it to translate let's to translate y and let's say one hundred pixels. All right.  
 
So let's save that...

```
body {
   background: #333;
   display: flex;
   align-items: center;
   justify-content: center;
   height: 100vh;
}

.box {
   background: white;
   width: 300px;
   height: 300px;
   /* transform: rotate(25deg); */
   /* transform: skew(25deg); */
   /* transform: scale(2); */
   transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
}

.box:hover {
   /* transform: rotate(180deg);
   transform: skew(25deg);
   transform: scale(2); */
   
   transform: translateY(100px);
}  
```  
 
* Now when I hover over this it's going to move it down a hundred pixels.  
 
So I didn't have to do like a position relative or a top top one whatever property. It just simply moves a hundred pixels.  
 
* And now if I want to move it up on the y axis I can simply put a negative value so negative 100 is going to move it up...

*transform: translateY(-100px);*

*(76.8) use transform: translateX();*...

And if I want to do on the x axis I can do translate X to 100 pixels... 

```
body {
   background: #333;
   display: flex;
   align-items: center;
   justify-content: center;
   height: 100vh;
}

.box {
   background: white;
   width: 300px;
   height: 300px;
   /* transform: rotate(25deg); */
   /* transform: skew(25deg); */
   /* transform: scale(2); */
   transition: all 1s ease-in-out;
}

.box:hover {
   /* transform: rotate(180deg);
   transform: skew(25deg);
   transform: scale(2); */
   
   transform: translateY(100px);
   transform: translateX(100px);
}  
```  
 
And that's going to go over  
 
* and if I want to go the other way I could of course do a negative value there...
 
*transform: translateX(-100px);*

*(76.9) use transform: translate();*...

Now let's say I want to move it on the x and y axis I can just use translate.  
 
I can say transform translate...

```
.box:hover {
   /* transform: rotate(180deg);
   transform: skew(25deg);
   transform: scale(2); */
   
   transform: translateY(100px);
   transform: translateX(100px);
   transform: translate(100px, 100px);
}  
```  
 
* And this is gonna take in the x and the Y parameters so let's say one hundred pixels on the x axis one hundred pixels on the y axis.  
 
* And now when I hover over it it will go one hundred over and one hundred down. And of course I could use negative values if I wanted to.

*(76.10) transform: translate3d();*...

* Now for if you want to increase performance you can actually use translate 3D which I don't use all that much  
 
but we can do translate 3D and let's actually comment this stuff.  
 
So if we use translate 3D this actually has to have a z value as well...

```
.box:hover {
   /* transform: rotate(180deg);
   transform: skew(25deg);
   transform: scale(2); */
   
   transform: translateY(100px);
   transform: translateX(100px);
   transform: translate(100px, 100px);
   transform: translate3d(100px, 100px, 100px);
}  
```  
 
So hundred pixels and that's gonna do the same thing. OK.  
 
And I believe it increases performance if you use translate 3D and you can do some really cool things I mean I'm not that familiar with it. I usually use translate but it is available to us.  
 
All right. So that's the transform property we'll be using this later on in other projects but that's going to be it for this video guys and I'll see you in the next one.
