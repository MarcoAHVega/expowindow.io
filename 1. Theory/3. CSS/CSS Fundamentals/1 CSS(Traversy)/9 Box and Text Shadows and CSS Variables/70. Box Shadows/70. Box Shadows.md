-------------------------------------------

*(70.1) the box shadow property*...

* So we have our boxes and then I'm just gonna add some base styling to the box class as well Before we get into the shadows.  
 
* So just some padding and let's do some margin and let's see we'll do. Let's do a background of coral and we'll see color white. All right...

```
.container {
display: flex;
}

.box {
padding: 1rem;
margin: 1rem;
background: coral;
color: #fff;
}  
```  
 
* So now we have some boxes now we're gonna add some shadows  
 
so I'm going to say...

*box-shadow:*  
 
now like I said there's there's different basically options or values that you can that you can use.  
 
* So I'm going to paste in a comment right above and we're going to put in three values here to to start off with.  
* So the first is going to be the offset x next will be the offset Y and the last will be the color...

```
.container {
display: flex;
}

.box {
padding: 1rem;
margin: 1rem;
background: coral;
color: #fff;
/* offset-x | offset-y | color */
box-shadow:
}  
```  
 
* So you guys know what a shadow is it just comes off the box.  
 
Now offset X is going to be on the x axis.  
 
* X is always gonna be horizontal  
 
* Y is vertical  
 
so let's say for the x axis or am sorry X offset we want to do 10 pixels  
 
and then for the Y we'll do 10 pixels as well.  
 
And then next will be the color. I'm going to use teal.  
 
It's kind of kind of weird colors but I just wanted to stand out. So let's go ahead and save that...

```
.container {
display: flex;
}

.box {
padding: 1rem;
margin: 1rem;
background: coral;
color: #fff;
/* offset-x | offset-y | color */
box-shadow: 10px 10px teal;
}  
```  
 
* And as you can see it added a box shadow it put 10 pixels on the x axis ten on the Y. All right.

*(70.2) to add the Blur-radius*...

Now I'm gonna be adding different box shadow values the next one I want to add the *Blur-radius* because there's actually more that you can add and one of them is a blur-radius.  
 
* So this is gonna have four parameters  
 
so I'm going to copy what I did here  
 
* and this is just going to overwrite the one before it.  
 
So the blow radius is going to be after the offset y and before the color and the blow radius is just that it's going to add a blur effect to it and it's in pixels so let's say 20 pixels and we'll save...

```
/* offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | color */
box-shadow: 5px 5px 20px teal;  
```  
 
* And now notice that the shadows have a blur.  
 
And if these stick out too much for you if you want them to be less you could do like five pixels and save and now it's less and you can experiment with it.

*(70.3) negative values for the offsets*...

Now you can also do negative values for the offsets.  
 
* What that will do is it will add the shadow to the top and the left  
 
*by default we have the shadow coming out of the right and the bottom.*  
 
But what we could do is just copy copy this line here and let's just say negative five and negative 5 and save...

```
/* Negative values */
box-shadow: -5px -5px 20px teal;  
```  
 
* And now you can see that the shadow was actually on the left and the top.  
 
OK so negative five on the X is going to go this way negative five on the Y is going to go up. All right.

*(70.4) spread-radius*...
 
* Now we can also do a spread radius so how far do we want it to spread.  
 
So I'm going to actually copy these comments again and I'm just putting these comments here so you know what each of these values are.  
 
So let's grab this one here.  
 
So we'll say let's do three pixels for the offset. Why offset X blur radius. Let's do 10 pixels  
 
and then see for the spread radius. We'll do one pixel  
 
and then instead of using a solid color I'm going to use our GPA. So it's red green blue alpha.  
 
So the red green blue we've went over this. I'm going to use zero for them all which will make it black. And then the Alpha is a transparency.  
 
So we're going to do zero point three here and save...

```
/* offset-x | offset-y | blur-radius | spread-radius | color */
box-shadow: 3px 3px 10px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);  
```  
 
So this is something  
 
*I don't really use box shadows that much I don't particularly like the look of them. Some people do if I were to use them it would be something like this something very very subtle.  

So as in I would probably use our GPA because the the the less transparent the lighter this is if we were to do like zero point nine and save. You can see it's much darker. Now you may like that kind of look but I don't I think it looks really you know 2002 ish.  

So I don't use shadows that much but nevertheless you should know how to how to add them. All right.

*(70.5) we can also do an inset*...

Let's see we can also do an inset box shadow  
 
* meaning that it's not coming it's on on the outside it's on the inside.  
 
So I'm going to just paste this in here and let's say box shadow and we can specify inset and then we do the offset x x and y. So I'm actually going to do negative three pixels and negative three.  
 
So that's at the left and the top.  
 
And let's do teal and save...

```
/* inset | offset-x | offset-y | color */
box-shadow: inset -3px -3px teal;  
``` 
 
* I'm sorry not the left in the top it's going to be down here because when you do inset it's the opposite. If I wanted it to be the left in the top I would do positive values shows you how much I actually who's this.  
 
But yeah we can do that if we want.  
 
It's now it's on the inset of the box it's not coming like from the outside.

*(70.6) multiple shadows*...

And then we can also do multiple shadows 

so to do that we could say like Box shadow and we could do let's say 
three pixels, three pixels, teal, 

and then we can put a comma 

and let's do negative three pixels, negative three pixels, and we'll do all of it's gonna be very ugly. But just to show you how this works if I save...

```
/* Multiple shadows */
box-shadow: 3px 3px teal, -3px -3px olive;  
```  
 
* you can see now I have the teal shadow box shadow right here and then the all of. Up top.

*So you can separate them with a comma if you want to add more ]*...

* and of course you could add a blur radius if we do let's do 10 pixels here and 10 pixels here and we'll save and we get our blurry radius.  
 
OK. So that's going to be it for box shadows guys like I said it's not something that I usually use I don't I don't really like the look of them but that's how how you use them in the next video we're going to take a look at text shadows.
