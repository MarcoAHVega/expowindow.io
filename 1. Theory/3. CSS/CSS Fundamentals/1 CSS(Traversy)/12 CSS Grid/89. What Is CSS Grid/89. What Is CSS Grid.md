# 89. What Is CSS Grid

*(89.1) So what is the grid*...

It's a grid layout system for CSS.  
 
it's similar to flexbox in that you can do a lot of the same things that you can do at flexbox.  
 
However there are some big differences.  
 
The biggest being that the grid is capable of two dimensional layouts.  
 
CSS grid is a bit harder to use than flex but it's also more powerful and we can use we can still use the same alignment properties that we've used with Flex such as aline-items, justify-content

*(89.2) the biggest difference between flex and the grid*...

Now the biggest difference between flex and the grid is that  
 
*Flex is not capable of two dimensional layouts,*  
 
you use it for a single row or column and you just set your alignments  
 
*with the grid You can have two dimensional layouts.*  

And you can actually *span items across multiple columns in multiple rows.*  

   
*(89.3) different use cases for grid and flex*...

There's different use cases for grid and flex.  
 
For me I like to *use CSS grid for outer elements basically boxes (containers) and grid like layouts*   
 
and then *for simple alignments or inner elements, things like menu items, landing pages were centering elements in a flex column, use flex.*   
 
Some people will use only one or the other but those people generally don't understand the difference and they use cases.
