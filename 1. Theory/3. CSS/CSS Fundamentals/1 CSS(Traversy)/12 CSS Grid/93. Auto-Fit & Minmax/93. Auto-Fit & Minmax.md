*All right so in this video we're going to look at `auto-fit and minmax`*...

which can make your grid kind of responsive.  
 
And it's good in certain situations not so good in some other situations  
 
it's great for like image gallery stuff like that but probably not so much for just regular Web site layout.  
 
*let's set `display: grid,` on to our parent element*...

*and then we're gonna set `grid-template-columns:`*...

*And I want to set it to `repeat()`*...

*and I want to set in here `Auto-fit,`*...

*And then instead of just setting a width here I'm going to use `minmax()` (which is a minimum and a maximum)*...

So it's gonna take in `those two things`  
 
*I'm going to say*...

a `minimum of 300 pixels` a `maximum of 1 Fr` (which is just the whole fraction) 

So let's save this...

```
.grid {
   display: grid;
   grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
}  
```  
 
and let's open this up OK.  
 
So immediately you can see that there's at this browser size we have two columns. Right.  
 
But as soon as I get to three hundred pixels, which is our minimum it's going to just go to it.  
 
They're going to stack.  
 
So it's pretty responsive.  
 
And if I go bigger you'll see we'll have three until it hits they hit three hundred.  
 
Goes back goes to two bigger.

*Now if we were to make this to like 200px*...

```
.grid {
   display: grid;
   grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
}  
```  
and let's add in a bunch of items (10) here...

```
<div class="grid">
      <div class="item">Item 1</div>
      <div class="item">Item 2</div>
      <div class="item">Item 3</div>
      <div class="item">Item 4</div>
      <div class="item">Item 4</div>
      <div class="item">Item 4</div>
      <div class="item">Item 4</div>
      <div class="item">Item 4</div>
      <div class="item">Item 4</div>
      <div class="item">Item 4</div>
      <div class="item">Item 4</div>
      <div class="item">Item 4</div>
   </div>  
```  
 
and save.  
 
So now you can see that it's it's pretty responsive.  
 
It stacks here

*but it's only good for certain types of content in my opinion*...

I don't use it for regular layout  
 
because if I wanted to have like let's just let's say I just wanted three boxes right  
 
where we have an icon some text it's like the features or whatever for the Web site.  
 
I don't ever want it to be like that.  
 
*You know so I like to have more control over it in media queries*   

so that I can set it to be either three or stack two like that. 

*I don't want this midpoint here.* 

So it's good for some some things but not so good for others. 

Image galleries things like that it's really good for. 

But I did want to just show you that.
