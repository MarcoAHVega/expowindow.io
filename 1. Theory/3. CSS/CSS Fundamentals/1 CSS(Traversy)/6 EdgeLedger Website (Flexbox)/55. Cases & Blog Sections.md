& 55. Cases & Blog Sections
   OK. So now we want to start on our cases which is basically our photo gallery section and also the blog section. So let's go into our HD e-mail and under the solutions let's say cases and we'll have a section. We're going to give us an idea of cases because it's part of the menu and then a class of cases. And we're gonna use a class called flex grid and also a class of Section padding. Now in here we're gonna have a header with a class of section header and headers don't have to be just for you know the main web site had or you can use them for articles or for whatever. And in here we're gonna have an H for and say this is what we do underneath that will have an H two and let's say business cases then a paragraph and we'll do Lorem 10 here. So that's our header. Now underneath that we're gonna have our row so class of row and then a column column. So within each column we're actually going to have two images so let's have our first image here which is gonna be say images slash cases and then cases one and then the second one will be cases 2 and then we'll just grab this column. So we're gonna have four columns. So that's one two three four with two images each. So this will be image 3 cases 3 4 5 6 7 and 8. OK. So that should be it as far as the each time all goes here. So we'll save that. And if we take a look we're just going to have large stretched out images. And this is the header which also we are meaning to style. So let's go into style CSX and as far as what we need to do here. Actually the only thing we need to do here is for the image I want to add a hover effect and set the opacity to what's to zero point seven. OK. So we just have that hover effect. The rest of this stuff is going to basically it's going to be for the header the section header and then the grid. So let's go into utilities because we're going to reuse these classes later. Anything that we're going to reuse is going to go into utilities. So let's do the section header first section header we're going to add padding 30 pixels let's display flex but we're going to change it to a column. So flex direction column and we want to align everything to the center. So a line items to the center we want to set the justified content to the center and text align to the center. So if we take a look at that everything is now centered and then let's style the H two so section header H to give that font size of 40 pixels and then let's add margin say 20 pixels on the top and bottom. Now we also have a class of Section padding. So I'm going to add that as well as so section padding and let's do 20 on the top. Yeah we'll do 20 20 left and right 40 on the bottom. So if we take a look good now we want to do the Flex grid class that we created that has a row and a column class in it. So right here we'll say flex grid and we want to style the row so as a class of row we're gonna display flex and set the Flex wrap. And let's just say padding for pixels on the sides. So that's the row. And then for the column let's say flex grid column we want these to have we want these to be 25 percent each. Because remember there's this four images across I mean there's eight images but we have two in each column such and B column two that should just be column. So flex grade column we're gonna set the flex to a percentage. So instead of like flex one or whatever let's do 25 percent and make sure that we have a max width of 25 percent so it doesn't go over that and then add padding on the sides for pixels. All right. Now we want to do so. Take a look at this. So looks pretty good actually. Yeah. So we'll just keep that if we make this smaller you know the images get real small but. Like I said we're gonna add media queries later to Stack Stack everything on top of each other. So that should do it for that. Now the next section is this blog section which is very similar to the solutions. So what we'll do is in our h t AML let's just copy the solutions section and paste that in here. And this is going to be blog. We're just going to change. First of all it's an I.D. of blog because we have the many pointing to it and then also the class say blog. And then we just have to change basically change the content so the image here will be in the home blog and then for the tax it's gonna be formatted the same way but we'll just change the actual content. Let's say April 16 20 20. So we'll just pretend that this is like a teaser for the first blog post or the latest blog post or whatever and we'll leave this we'll just say read our blog. Now I do want the image to be on the other side. We could change the HD PML like we could. Take this image put it here put the text here but I don't want to do that I'd rather just add a class of flex reverse. So if I add that let's go to utilities and for for Flex reverse we can just go. So that's the that's flex columns right. So I'm going to go up to the top here and let's say so if it's flex columns and it has a class of flex reverse then we want the ROE to change. We want to change the Flex direction to Roe reverse because it's just going to switch it. So if we take a look now the image is on that side. Now I also want this to be a different color which we made it really easy to do that because we have utility classes for backgrounds so we can simply change it to secondary or darker whatever you want. So now we have that blue background. So I mean hopefully you can see the pattern here we just create these classes that we can reuse whenever we want these specific types of layouts. So the next one is the team which again has a section header which is identical to this section header. All right. So that'll make it easy to do that. And then we just have these flex items so we can use the Flex items class that we used here with the icons. OK. So it makes it really easy to just keep adding sections. So in the next video we'll go ahead and get into those.
