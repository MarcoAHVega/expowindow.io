& 53. Hero Section & Overlay
   OK so now we're going to create our main hero image with the overlay. So let's jump back in to our style sheet here and I'm going to go under the now bar styling. Let's just say header in our header has a class of hero. So for the background we want an image. So we're gonna say U.R.L. and let's put in here the location of the image which is up one level in images and then in home and call it showcase showcase. I don't know why it's not popping up here. Showcase j peg I think that's correct. So we go images home. Yeah. Showcase. OK. So we want to add some other background properties. Let's say no repeat. And let's center. So for the background position we want to center it on the x and y access and then we also want it to cover in terms of the background size. Now I want the height of this hero class. Let's head out to be the entire viewport. So one hundred viewport heights and I'm going to add a position relative and I'll explain that a little later when we do the overlay and then the color set to white. OK. So if we take a look at that it's not showing for some reason. Let's see. Background you are l 0 images. OK. So we get the background image. But notice that it's pretty bright. If we look at the final version it's much darker because we have to create that overlay. And I didn't want to just you know make it darker in photoshop or something like that. We want to do it through CSX but before we even get to the overlay I want to position the content because right now it's just behind the nav bar we want it to be in the center here and we can center it pretty easily with Flex blocks. So let's grab the content. So we have hero content and we want to display flex and instead of being a row because if it's a row you can see that now if you look behind the nav bar that stuff is all like oh it's aligned horizontally and we don't want that. So we're gonna change the direction to column. OK so that'll put it back to going vertical and then we can use a line items center and justified content center. And let's also align the text center. Now if we take a look you can see it is aligned this way. So it's a line it's aligned on the cross access because remember this is a flex column. So this is the main access. This is the cross so a line items put it in the center here justify content should put it in the center here. But the reason it's not is because there's no height. So what we'll do since the parent which is the hero has a height of 100 viewport heights will set the height of this to 100 percent of its container. So if I go ahead and do that now it's right in the middle. OK so before we move on to the overlay I just want to style this because obviously this doesn't look very good. So let's do the let's do the H1. I'm sorry there's some other stuff I want to do here. Well I just want to add some padding. So it's a padding it's just 20 pixels on each side just so it doesn't you know rub up against the side on smaller screens. So hero contents each one. I'm going to make this pretty large. So let's do font size 55 pixels and then the paragraph. So hero content paragraph I'm going to set the font size on this to be a little larger. Let's do twenty three pixels. And I want to set a max width so that the paragraph doesn't extend too far out. So set that to six hundred pixels and then let's set margin we'll do 20 pixels top zero. Left and Right. Thirty bottom. So we'll take a look at that. That looks pretty good. Now as far as this link goes. It has a class of b t n now B10 is gonna be utility class that we can reuse so we don't want to do you know hero B T N because then it only applies to the hero. So in utilities we're gonna go ahead and add our button. So it's a button B T N. So first of all I'm going to set the cursor to a pointer and then we want to set the display from inline to inline block and we're gonna add some padding to it. So let's do 10 pixels top and bottom 30 left and right let's set the color to whites. Let's set the tone we want to do it's too background. So the background color I'm going to set to the primary color by default which is this here and then let's go ahead and set the border to none and then we'll add a little bit of a curve on the corners so border radius we'll do five pixels right now for the hover. So let's say button hover. We could change the color. We could do a few different things I'm just gonna change the opacity and make it more see through so we'll do zero point nine. Just make it slightly translucent. And then I also want to have other button classes for different colors as well if we want. So let's create a B10 so B10 primary. Actually we don't really need the primary because we're using that as the default. But we'll go ahead and just added here anyway. So we want the backgrounds to be that color and the color to be white. So if you want to use B10 primary and get rid of this you can. But I'm just going to keep it this way. So we can't it's just optional if we want to use this. Now we want some other button classes as well. So let's have Beatty secondary so it's almost like creating your own framework your own CSX framework because these are these are classes similar to what you'd see in like bootstrap. So the secondary color is going to be that and then I'm also going to do a B10 dark where the background color is 3 3 3 and then let's also do a light button light where the color is light gray but the other backgrounds like gray. But the color is dark. OK. So those are our button utility classes. So if we take a look you can see now we have our button we have the opacity effect and we hover over it. So now we're ready to create our overlay. And like I said we're gonna be using a pseudo selector called before. So in our style sheet here style CSX let's go ahead and say hero. And the way we want to use this is we want to do double colon and then before. Now there's before and there's after. And what this does is it allows us to insert content before or after this element. So we can have this content property and we can actually put Texas in here like hello. And if I save this and I go back you'll see up here in the corner behind the nav bar it has the text Hello which we just inserted using CSX. Now I don't want to put actual content like text. So we just want to leave that blank. We do need this property but we're going to leave this as just an empty string. OK now what we do want to do is create an overlay. So basically put a color over it over the entire thing. So we want to position this to be absolute within hero. That's why up here I put position relative because remember with positioning if you have something absolute within a parent the parent has to be position relative. And as far as placement let's put it. We'll say top 0 left 0. And then we want it to cover the entire thing so 100 percent with 100 percent height. And then if we set the background let's say we'll say background red for now and let's take a look and we just have this large red overlay. So this is covering everything. It starts here and it's 100 percent with hundred percent high. And it covers everything. Now in order to make this transparent we could use opacity or we could use in our G.B. a value. So red green blue Alpha and said it's a black 0 0 0 and then we'll do zero point six for the transparency. So if I save that and we take a look now we have an overlay. Now one problem that you can see here is that the the text and the button it's behind the overlay. So we need to move that forward and we can do that with the z index property so z index is just the level of of you know where it is from front to back. So right now the content is behind the overlay so it has a lower z index and your z index can be any number it can be negative or positive. So what I'll do here is I'll say anything that is in hero let's set the z index to we'll set it to 10. So it should be safe with 10. And now if we take a look the content is in front of the overlay. OK. This is because the higher the z index the closer to you it is the closer to the screen. If it's a lower easy index then the further back it is. OK. So I mean that's pretty much it as far as the the top part of our Web site. So in the next video we're going to start on you know these down here will create some flex items and do this part here as well and we'll go from there.
