& 58. Inner Pages
   OK so now we're going to create our inner pages so we have a blog. Each team I'll page that we want to create and also a single post page. So what we'll do is see. Let's go into our age team. And I just want to check out the button so the blog section which is right here this read our blog The eight drafts should go to blog Dot HMO. And by the way we haven't even looked at the navigation. So if I click about it takes us down Casey's blog contact and we'll add some javascript to do the smooth scrolling. But if you don't want to add any javascript you can just leave it the way it is. If you want but we'll we'll get to that in a little bit. But let's take care of these inner pages. So if I go to the blog and I click read our blog it doesn't exist. So we have to create that file. So let's say blog Dot HMO and what we'll do is copy everything from index age HTML and paste that in and we're going to get rid of it see we're going to keep the header we're just going to modify it so everything that is between actually everything in the main we'll go ahead and get rid of for now so we'll get rid of that. And for the title we'll just say read our blog and let's see what we want to do here. So this stuff is going to stay the same. Now the hero. I don't want it to take up the entire page so I'm going to add another class onto the header called blog and that's you want to keep that. Now these these here since we're on a different page obviously we can't go to the about section. So what we want to do is we want to point to first of all home can just go to index each team. All right. And then if we want to go to a bow we'll go to index start h t AML and then the about section. So basically we just need to prefix all of these with index H Timo like that and then let's see for the content we're just going to have each one and just say blog. All right. Now I'm going to save this and if we go to our blog page this is obviously way too big. So I want to I want to make this smaller. I so want to change the image. So what we'll do is go into our style she let's go to style CSX and go down to where we have our hero and we're going to add go right here and let's say hero. Now if this also has a class of blog then let's change the background image and you could do this with other inter pages as well have different classes for those different images. So we're gonna go up one level into images and then what is it. Yes. Actually I have it in the home folder. It's the same. Same image that we have on the home for the blog. And then no repeat center center cover. And I'm going to change it from height of 100 viewport hides to thirty viewport heights. So if I go ahead and save this and now we take a look. Now we just have a much smaller header now for the content. I actually want to structure it like we did with this with the flex columns. So what I'll do is grab C from the index page I'm going to grab the solutions section and let's go back here and inside main we're gonna go ahead and paste that in here and see. So we have section let's actually make this an article instead. So make sure you switch that and the ending tag to article and we don't need a class of solutions we do want the Flex columns though and then for the image let's use images. So this is the first post so we'll do blog 1 as our image and for the content. Let's see we don't need we're actually gonna make this CPG light and then we don't need an H for because you're just gonna have the title just say blog post 1 and then let's see underneath that though let's have a paragraph with the class of meta and this is where we'll put like the the user and stuff. So I'm going to put a user icon so F.A. s and then F A Dash user. And then after that we'll say Posted by John Doe. Yeah actually let's put strong tags around the name. So John Doe and we'll put a pipe character here and then the date say April 19 20 20 and then we'll still have this read more down here as well. But let's make the button instead of outline let's say B10 dark which we should already have. All right. So if I save that we take a look and we go is our first blog post. So the second one I'm going to copy this whole article and I'll go down a pay set and then I'm just going to change the image to blog to I'm going to change the background to dark. It's a blog post to will change the user to Jane Doe changed the date and then for the button I want to you I want to use button light see what that looks like. OK. So there we go. So any time you want to use the styling it's super easy. So we'll go ahead and copy the first article again and go under this one and change this to blog three. I'm gonna go back to a dark background. Three. Just change the date. We'll keep the same author. And let's do. Button. Wait. All right. Oh actually I didn't want to change the colors I went on to keep the light because I want them to alternate so if I save that and we take a look. So we have the light the dark. We do want the image on the other side though. Actually it's only the middle that I want the image on this side. So remember we can just add our reverse class right. So flex columns we can just add flex reverse and now the image is on the other side. OK. That's our blog page. Now if I click on the read more it should go to a post. So for each link here let's have a go to post dot h t AML. So I'll just copy that and we want each of these to go to that page. In reality they would go to different posts obviously but they'd all be formatted the same way. So let's create post dot each team e-mail. Now this is gonna be pretty simple as well. Let's see so we'll copy the blog each team now and let's paste that in. So I'm going to keep going to keep the top here. Let's change the title though to post one. I'm going to keep all this and this too so it'll have that same hero image at the top. But then for the main let's clear everything out of the main so all these articles will clear out and then we're just going to have a section here with the class of post and we'll have an H two with the titles so blog post 1 and then underneath that we'll have our medic class which I'll just copy from the blog h t email so this paragraph right here also copy the text paragraph and then we'll just add a couple more paragraphs let's say like Lorem 60 now the paragraph Lorem 50 and then that should do it. So if we take a look at that if I click read more takes us to the post now I want to style some of this stuff. I also want the image in there as well so what we'll do is add let's see we'll go under the Metta input image and let's go to images slash blog and we'll take the blog one image. All right. Now as far as styling goes let's go to our style CSX and style the post. So I'll go. Let's go above the footer post and it had padding around the whole thing. We'll do 50 pixels top and bottom 30 left and right. We're gonna do the H to post H to let's say font size 40 pixels margin bottom. Let's do twenty pixels padding bottom we'll do 10 pixels and I want to add a board our bottom supporter bottom CCC solid 1 pixel so if we look at that I can see that's our title we have this underline for the matter I just want to push the content under it down so let's say post meta margin bottom 30 pixels. Now the image is huge. So because by default its width 100 percent. So let's change that. So the Post image I'm going to set the width to a fixed three hundred pixels and I'm going to make it rounded so we'll say border radius 50 percent. I want to display as a block because I want to put it in the middle without using flex so we can display block because by default it's in line and then we'll add margin 0 auto on the left and right and then 30 on the bottom. So now if we take a look. So it's going to look like OK. So I mean you'd probably have like a sidebar with categories and stuff like that if it were a real blog. But this is just something very simple just to add to the site. OK. So I think we're done as far as you know h t AML and CSX. Let's just make sure if we make this smaller that the blog page still looks ok. Yes everything is just stacked. We go to the post that looks good. All right. So in the next video we're going to add a little bit of JavaScript this part is definitely optional you don't have to do this but I like the effect of this being trans totally transparent at the top. And then when you scroll down you know the background comes in also will implement the Lightbox library so we can open these images up in a light box. All right. So I'll see you in the next video.
