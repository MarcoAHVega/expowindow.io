& 57. Responsive Media Queries
   All right guys so we're gonna go ahead and add our media queries now to make this responsive and look good in all of our media queries are going to go in our style sheet. Actually we only have one. We just want to have some styles for anything that's under 768 pixels so basically a tablet or less. So let's go down here and we'll just say mobile and we want a media query so we want at media and I'm going to do a max width of 768 pixels. So basically anytime the screen is smaller than 768 these styles will kick in. So let's start with the nav bar ok because right now we can see the links are going off the screen. So remember it's it's a flex row. So what I'll do is I'll change the Flex direction to a column and immediately there. Now they're on top of each other the logo and the you. So I'm just going to set a line items to send. Yeah I'll set a line items to center and let's set the the I'm sorry not a line items justify what did I have here so had now Bala. All line item center. OK. Justify. Content is space. I guess we can just. We don't have to do anything with that. So forget that. Now the height. I'm going to change to one hundred and twenty pixels because it needs to be higher now because obviously we have the logo on top of the links. And then let's add some padding padding 20 pixels. OK. So it's pretty good. Now these links are still pretty far apart on so on smaller phones. You know these might kind of run into each other so let's change the padding on those. So we'll say now var links. I believe we have 10 20. So let's do 10 10. OK. So now you can see the links are closer together will even less than the margin. So we had five pixels will set three pixels. So now they're closer together and should look fine on smaller phones. OK. So now bar looks pretty good and neat. I mean you could always do like a hamburger menu or something but this is just a pretty simple solution that doesn't include any javascript. Now this I'm going to keep this. I mean you could lessen the size of the H2 here if you want but I think that looks pretty good. Now the Flex items obviously want to change you want to stack these so flex items. So it's already display flax we're just going to change the direction to a column. All right. So it's as easy as that. So basically you know if this is when it gets to 768 it just stacks on top of each other. And you could do a different ways you could instead of display flax you could change it to display block or something like that but I like just changing the direction. Let's see. Next we have this. So what's this flex. Columns yes of flex columns for the actual column what we'll do is we'll set the Flex value or the Flex grow to 100 percent. And also the max with to 100 percent. So if we save that you can see now these both stack on top of each other. All right. So that's one way to do it. And we can even do that with the grid. Let's see. So these images right here have flex grid. So I think we could just take flex grid and take the column there and that will. Yeah that'll stack them on top of each other as well. So if we make this bigger yeah I mean you could you could add another media query and have them in to you know for like 768. You could have them in two rows and then on smaller screens stack them. But I think that's fine we'll just we'll just leave it like that. All right. So what else do we have here. Let's see. This is good because remember that's the the Flex column. This is good. These are stacked because these are flex items. However I do want these images to be a little smaller so what we could do is take the team image and instead of one hundred percent width we could do let's say 70 percent ok make them a little smaller. I think that looks a little neater. Maybe we could even do that with the image. I guess that's fine. So this looks good footer photos fine. I don't think we need to do anything there. So I think we're all set as far as media queries go. So our site looks pretty good on small screens and we can test it out with the device toolbar as well so if we open up our chrome tools and hit this icon here. So that's an iPad let's try iPhone X OK. So I think that looks pretty good. It's try Galaxy S5. It's even smaller still looks good. IPhone 6 7 8. OK. So our site's responsive now in the next video we're going to create the blog page which is pretty simple and also the single blog post page.
