& 52. Header HTML & Navbar Styles
   OK so we're gonna get started and I'm just going to have the final project open here in case there's something we need to reference and we're gonna start basically top to bottom I want to do the whole hero image and nav bar first so we'll do the HDMI all for that and then we'll jump to the styling and then we'll move on and go section by section so I'm gonna open up this code and I have all the images already in here and you can get these in the section resources and you can see I have them all in categories so if the blog images the cases the home images the team and we have a fab Akon PMG here that that we're going to implement later we're actually going to convert it to an ICAO file and use that as our fab Akon. So let's go ahead and create in the root here index h t AML which obviously is our home page our main landing page and then let's also we'll create the other EU pages later. Let's create the CSX folder and inside there will create a style dot CSX now like I said in the intro we're gonna be using a lot of utility classes like four buttons and backgrounds and stuff like that almost like a a built in framework so we can just throw these classes in where we need them. So I'm actually going to have to style sheets I'm going to create another one called utilities dot CSX. And classes that will reuse as utilities will go in here for buttons tax background stuff like that. OK so we'll have to see SS files. Now let's create a boilerplate in our h t AML so exclamation enter and let's say welcome to edge ledger for our title and then we want to link in both of our style sheets. Now the the the utilities CSX we want to put first and then under that the main style CSX. That way if we have to overwrite any of the utility styling we can do that in our style CSX. Now we're also going to be using font awesome. So we want to use me when I grab that real quick I'm going to go to S.D. NJ s dot com and just search for font and grab this right here. Click on the CSX version and grab the link for the all dot men dot CSX file. So if we say copy link tag copy that we can close that up and then just paste that right in the head and we should be all set for now as far as the head goes. So for the body we're going to have a an HMO five header tag and I'm going to give this a class of hero. So this is basically the entire you know the everything above the fold the the main image and also the nav bar will be within the header. So let's create a div with the class of nav bar actually will give us an I.D. too because we're gonna need it for the little bit of JavaScript that we add later. I mean we could use a class but when when I take elements from the DOM using javascript I like to use an I.D.. So within here we want our logo so that's gonna be an H1. I'll give it a class of logo and we're gonna have our font font awesome icon here for our logo. So FAA us and now let's do F A Dash book dash open and then just a space and edge ledger. OK. Now I do want to have the the icon or the logo and the word edge. I want those to be green as you can see right here. So we're gonna use a utility class called text primary that will create later on. So let's actually surround this in a span OK. We definitely want to use a span because if we use a div which is a block level element the word ledger is gonna be put on the next line and we don't want that. So the span I'm gonna give a class of text primary and that's our logo. So under the H1 we're gonna have a nav with a you well and have our list items with links. And these are just going to go to areas on the page. So if we do hash home or no sign home that's going to go to an I.D. of home on the page. OK. So say home and I actually want that to go to the very top. So I'm going to give the body an idea of home and then we'll just go ahead and copy this down we want five links. So after home we'll have about and we want that to go to the I.D. of about then we'll have cases underneath cases is gonna be the blog section which will go to the idea of blog and then we'll have a contact OK so that's it for now. By now as far as the content in the header like the you know the sky's the limit heading and all that that's going to go under this now bar div. So we want to go under that and have a class of content. And here we'll have our H one. Say the sky is the limit. And we'll do a paragraph here and let's say we provide we provide world class financial assistance. And then underneath that we're going to have a link that's formatted as a button. So it'll be an A tag. But let's give it a class of B T N and this is just going to go to the about section and we'll say Read more. Let's actually put an icon in here though so I'm going to put an eye tag with the class of F.A. s and then a Chevron. So it's what is an F A Dash Chevron Dash. Right. So we'll just put that little icon in there and that should be it as far as the h him. So we can open this up with live server OK. So that's what it's going to look like now which doesn't look too good. So we're going to jump into the CSX into style dot CSX and we're going to start with just the base styles like the you know the body the the length stuff like that basically global styles. Now we are going to use the open Sands font. So we want to go to fonts dot google dot com and let's search for open Sands just right here and I'm going to grab the light 300 so select style. And then also the regular 400 and then over here we can click embed and you can either grab the link and put it in your each team L or the import which is what I'm going to do to take this import and copy that and then we'll put that in our style sheet. OK. So let's add some base styles here so we want to add box sizing border box on everything so that the width doesn't you know the padding doesn't take up the width. We want to just reset the padding and margin. So we're gonna set both of those to zero on everything and then for the body let's add the font family which is going to be open Sands and sans serif and for the background make that white by default and the color of the text will be dark grey almost black and then I like to usually do a line height of one point five one point six for the body and then for you Ells I want to I don't want any bullet points. So we want to set the list style to none. And on links so we'll just make the default color dark grey and then let's remove the underline with text decoration none. OK. So this applies to all links and then each ones in H twos so large headings I want to make it a light font weight. So we're gonna set that to 300 and then I'm just going to lessen the line height for headings large headings. We'll do one point two that way if they go onto multiple lines of words aren't too far apart vertically and then for paragraph remember we took away all the margins so I'm going to add 10 pixels on the top and bottom and then any images I want to have a width of 100 percent of their container by default. So those are the base styles. Now we do want to do the nav bar so we'll do that here but we I want to add the text classes we have that text primary class to our utilities. So let's just put a comment here and say text styles are text colors and we have text primary so that's just going to have a color it's going to be our green color which is hexadecimal to 8 a 7 4 5 is going to be that color and then we'll have a text secondary as well which will be a blue color so we'll set that to hexadecimal 0 2 8 4 D 0 and that will be our secondary. So now if we take a look here you can see we have that green now for the nav bar we want remember the now Bar has two items in it it has the the H one and it has the UL. So we want that do we want to set that to a flex box because we want those to align in a row and we want the UL to be way over here. Now the UL itself will also be a flex box so that these list items can you know float horizontally as well. So let's go to our style CSX and let's just put a comment here say nav bar so the Navarre is like I said it's going to be a flex box. So we want to set the display property to flex and let's align everything since it's a row a line items. Does the cross axis which is going to be vertical. So we want to align center and then as far as justified content which aligns on the main axis we're going to set that to space between because we want the H1 to be on one side and the you to be on the other. So if I go ahead and save that now you can see the UL is way over here and the logo is over here because we have space between four justified content. Now as far as the background will set the background color to Let's do three three three. And then the color will be white and I am going to make it a little bit see through add some. It's gonna be a little translucent so we'll set opacity to zero point eight. You don't have to but I think it gives it a nice effect. We want the width to be 100 per in the height is going to be 70 pixels which is pretty common for a Navarre and we want to position this. We want it to stick to the top so we're going to position this in a fixed position and from the top 0 pixels. So it will always be stuck to the top and then we want a little bit of padding on the sides and that everything so that the logo and the UL aren't right up against the sides. So we'll do the 30 pixels on the right and left. And that should do it for now. So if I save that that's what it's going to look like now. The links over here you can see are still vertical we also can't see them because they're the same colour as the background. So let's fix that. So first of all let's say nav bar any tags we're going to colour those whites and then we have our well and we want to display that as flex so that the list items align in a row. And that's pretty much all we need for the well. Now for the tags we want we want to space them out because if we take a look you can see they're all squished up against each other. So let's add padding I'm going to set padding too. Let's do 10 pixels top and bottom 20 left and right and then also margin on the left and right five pixels. And that should do it. So if we take a look at that that looks pretty good. Now I do want to have a hover effect. I'm going to add a board a border bottom on hover. So let's go right here and say nav bar call and hover and we'll say border bottom and Assad's the colour. I'm going to use this same Texas primary color right here and put that in. Of course we need the width which will be two pixels and the style which will be solid. And if we hover over these links and that's not working. Oh I put nav bar hover it should be nav bar a hover. And there we go. All right cool so I think that's pretty much it for the nav bar. Oh one thing I do want to do is bold the logo a little bit make the font way a little bigger so let's say nav bar and when that H1 has a class of logo and I'm just going to set the font weight from 300 to 400 and now it's a little bit more bold. OK. So in the next video we're gonna go ahead and do the the hero image we're going to add the background we're actually going to use a pseudo selector called before because you can use after and before to create an overlay because we don't want the the bright image we want to have this dark overlay over it. So we'll be doing that in the next video.
