& 54. Icons & Solutions Sections
   OK. So the top part of our site is complete. We all like I said we'll add the javascript for this later on where this is transparent. But now we want to do the this icons section and the solutions section. So we're gonna be using flex blocks to align everything. So let's jump into our age team l first and add that. So I'm going to go under the header and I'm actually going to use a main tag here and all of our sections aside from the footer we'll go inside this main tag. So our first section here I'm gonna give an idea of about so that our menu goes to it and then let's give it a class of icons and we're gonna have background classes as well utility classes and I want this to be light. So I'm gonna use a class of BFG light and we'll add we'll create that in a second and then for anything that we just want you know simple FLEX FLEX blocks rows I'm gonna have a utility class called flex items that we put directly on you know as the Flex container. So we're gonna have some divs and in the div will have an icon. Let's give this let's say F.A. s and then F A Dash university. So that's our icon that we're gonna use. I'm also gonna give it a class of f a dash to X which will make it twice as large. All right. And then underneath that will have a div with an H three. So this is just gonna be like a heading we'll say investment investment banking and then a paragraph and let's just do Lorem 10 for the paragraph. So that's the style of the or the format of each flex item. So we want to copy this down twice. The second icon is gonna be ebook reader and we just want to change the heading up here as well. So let's say investment. No we already did that let's say portfolio manager. OK then this third icon here is gonna be pencil dash all right. And for the heading let's say tax and custodial. So if we take a look at that doesn't look too good but we'll fix that. So let's jump into the CSX. So we're gonna go into style CSX first in any direct styling for the icons class will go here. So it's a icons. And I just want to add some padding. So we'll do 30 pixels for the whole thing and then for the H three say icons h three. I just want to bold the font so set font weight to Let's do 400 now do fold and then add some margin to the bottom. So 15 pixels now for the icons I want to style them so that so icons I the font awesome icons I want to style them so that they have this round background. So let's go ahead and set the background color to our green and I mean we we probably should be using variables or custom properties for this because reusing the colors but I haven't gone over those yet. Those are gonna come in a later section. So let's say color white and we want padding. So we want some spacing around it. So 16 actually we'll do one room which in this case will be 16 pixels because that's the root element font size border radius. I'm going to set that to 50 percent and then let's set a margin bottom of 15 pixels. OK. So if we take a look at our icons now we have this green round background. Now we want to deal with our Flex blocks because we want these aligned in a row. So in our utilities I'm going to I'm going to style the Flex items class that we used so let's say flex items and we want to display flex and let's go ahead and text align center and justify content center and also text align center. OK. So pretty simple. And I'm just going to set the height to 100 percent and then add some padding to the divs inside. So let's say flex items and we can say the direct div. So basically the you know the direct div child we're going to set a padding of twenty pixels. So let's take a look at that. And there we go. So looks pretty good. Yeah. So the next thing that we're gonna do is this section here. And for these two column layouts you'll see this looks similar to this one which looks similar to this one. So we're going to have a utility class called flex columns for these because it's gonna be slightly different than how we style though the three we just did. So let's jump in to our H team L and we want to go right under where we did the about actually we can. Let's put some comments here so that's let's about icons and then under this section this is part of the about section. This is the solutions. So we want to add a section here and let's give this a class of solutions and also a class of flex dash columns. And then within here let's let's create a row. So take note of the structure of this we're gonna have a row with two column div so say column times two and then inside this column we'll have a div called column 1. And in this one here we'll have a div with column two. All right. So this this first one is gonna be the image. So let's add that we'll say image and we want to go into images slash home and then people that's all we want in column 1 column 2 We're gonna have an H for we'll say what you are looking for and then an H two and we'll say we provide these spokes solutions and then a paragraph and let's do Lorem 20 I believe I did our warm 30 and I know we'll see how it looks. So that's column 2 and actually under the paragraph we do want a link formatted as a button we'll use B T and I'm also going to have a b t an outline class as well and we'll just put the text of read more but let's put an icon as well of a Chevron so we'll do F.A. as F A Dash Chevron shares the space after it. All right. So if we take a look at that we just have a stretched out image because remember it's with 100 percent by default we set that in our style CSX and then we have our content down here. So let's go ahead and style the Flex columns so this class right here. So we're gonna go to utilities and let's go under where we have our Flex items and I'm only creating this utility class because we're doing a few different sections that have the same exact styling. So let's say flex columns and we want to style the row and say display flex and the Flex direction is going to be a row which is default so we don't really need that. But we'll specify it any way we want the Flex wrap to be wrap and we want width to be 100 percent OK. And then for the columns let's say flex columns and then we have that class of column we also want to display flex here but we want the Flex direction obviously to be a column and we're gonna set the basis. So basically the default we're gonna set that to 100 percent and set it to flex 1. So it'll take up the entire height and then for column 1 and Column 2 Column 1 and then we'll copy that down column 2. We want the height. Make sure we set that to 100 percent as well. So let's take a look at what that looks like. Good. Now I want this to have a green background. So one thing I forgot in the HD UML is to add that C we want to put this on column 2 so so g primary. And by doing that it should be green or not. We didn't do the background classes yet did we. So let's quickly add those in our utilities. Now we already have the button classes and the big classes are going to have the same exact thing the background color with the text color. So what I'll do is what I'll do is just excuse me we'll say BJP primary and let's go here we'll say class BJP secondary we'll have a BJP dark and a BP light. All right. Now if we take a look we have that green background and it doesn't go all the way down just yet. We'll do that when we get to the column to styling. But for the image I just want to do the image for us because if we go to you know a certain width you can see the image starts to go up. We wanted to fill this entire area. So let's go back to let's go back down here. Oh we had a we had a in there but that should OK. So now it fell. Yeah. Now it fills the hole right. But as far as the image goes to fix that let's say flex columns image and set the. Make sure the width is 100 percent the height is 100 percent. And if we take a look the width in the height or 1 percent but see how it looks all stretched out we can easily fix that with a property called Object fit. And we can set that to cover which it works similar to background size cover with with a background image. So if we look now you'll see that it takes up the whole area but it's not stretched out. It just covers it. All right. So that's what we want. Now as far as column two what style that was flex columns and let's do column two and we want this to display flex so we can align it splay flex. We also want the direction to be a column and then we want to align items center. And let's. I'm sorry. Let's align items to flex start since it's a column a line items has to do with the horizontal. OK. And then justify. Content is going to be center. OK so center that and then just add some padding. And we should be good. All right. Now we do want to style some of the individual elements here. So the H two I'm going to make bigger I'm also going to add some margin and we've got to take care of this button outlying class that we created or that we used. So let's say flex columns H to instead of font size of 40 pixels and let's make the font weight one hundred and that's it for the H to the H for let's add a margin bottom of 10 pixels and then the paragraph flex columns paragraph. I want to add 20 pixels margin on the top and bottom so we save that. OK. That all looks good. Now for the button here I just want to have a border and I want a transparent background so just an outline. So let's go to style CSX up to where we have not style utilities up to where we have our buttons and let's add a Beatty an outline and we'll set the background to transparent and set a border of one pixel solid and white. OK so that'll be our button outlines. Take a look. Good. So that takes care of the icons that takes care of this. Now when we make this smaller it doesn't look too good. Later on we're going to add media queries so that you know everything stacks and the navigation looks better but we're gonna do the desktop version first. OK. And the next video we'll go ahead and we'll do the cases and hopefully get to the blog section as well which should be really easy because it's the same style as this except we want the image on this side. All right. So we'll get to that next.
