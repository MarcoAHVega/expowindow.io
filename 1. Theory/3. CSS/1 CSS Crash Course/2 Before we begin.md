# before we begin

let me go over a few points to give you an idea of what this video is and what it is not

first i would like to mention this course is for complete beginners

i'm going to assume you have no prior knowledge of css and teach the course

if you are someone who is already familiar with css this is your cue to probably hop into
another video where your time can be better utilized

second this video is a continuation of the html crash course

so make sure you are familiar with html before proceeding

third we're going to learn the fundamentals of css

css contains a plethora of concepts varying from simple syntax to advanced topics that are relatively more difficult

to understand we will focus on topics that a beginner must know when getting started with web development

you can then use that knowledge to add styles to your web pages based on your artistic knowledge

very similar to how you learn the basics of a guitar string and then use that knowledge to play any song which you like

it is worth mentioning that some of the buzzwords that you might have heard
like flexbox and css grid will be their own separate videos

and this video will just be about the fundamentals of css

finally unlike other videos in my channel this video is a crash course and is longer in
length

that doesn't mean you have to sit through the entire video at once

take it easy pause when necessary and most importantly make sure you code along with me as that is the best way to learn

by the end of this video you will have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of css
all right with these points in mind let's get started
