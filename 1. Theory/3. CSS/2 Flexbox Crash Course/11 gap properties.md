# gap properties

all right let's now move on to the next set of properties which deal with spacing between rows and columns
first we have the column gap property which sets the gap between columns
for example if we set column gap 20 pixels and refresh
we can see a gap of 20 pixels between the columns
similarly we can also set the gap between rows the property is row gap
and we can set it to 30 pixels to verify this property though we need
more than one row so let's set flex wrap to wrap and head back to the browser
refresh and reduce the browser width
you can see there is now a 30 pixel gap between the two rows
now it's also possible to specify both column and row gap using the gap
shorthand property so let's comment these out and instead
set gap to 40 pixels and 20 pixels
here the first value is the row gap and the second value is the column gap
when i refresh you can see 40 pixels between the rows
and 20 pixels between the columns so to specify a gap between columns you
can use the column gap property to specify gap between rows you can use
the row gap property you can also use the shorthand gap property to specify both row gap and
column gap the values can be a non-negative value or a percentage
