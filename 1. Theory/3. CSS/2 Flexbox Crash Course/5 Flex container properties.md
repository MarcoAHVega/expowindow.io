# flex container properties

- > there are 10 flex container properties in total

now familiar let's begin by focusing first on the
properties that are associated with just the flex container

there are 10 in total

- > display

first we have the display property

this is what defines a flex container and is mandatory to work with flexbox

- > flex-direction

next is flex direction

it defines the direction in which the flex items are placed within the
container

- > flex-wrap

third we have flex wrap which is used to control the wrapping of items within the
container

- > flex-flow

we then have flex flow which is a shorthand for the combination of flex
direction and flex wrap

- > column-gap and row-gap

we then have column and row gap
properties to set the gap between columns and rows

- > gap

and just gap which is a shorthand for
both

- > justify-content

there is justify content that defines the alignment of the items along the main
axis

- > align-items

and similarly align items which defines how flex items
are laid out along the cross access

- > align-content

finally we have the align content
property

this is similar to justify content with the difference being this will align
along the cross access and not mean access

also this works only when there are
multiple rows of flex items in the container

all right now that we know the properties that can be applied to a flex container let's take a closer look at each of them
