# flex-direction

the next property we are going to learn is flex direction the flex direction establishes the main
axis which in turn decides how the flex items are placed within the flex container
by default the main axis flows from left to right which is the reason we see the
items placed from left to right in the browser by changing the value of the flex
direction property we can change how the items are placed
let's revert display to flex and now define the flex direction
property this property can accept one of four different values
the first value is row which is the default value so if we set flex direction to row
and refresh you can see it doesn't make a difference
the items still flow from left to right flex direction of row sets the main axis
from left to right and hence no change
the next alert value is row reverse and you might have guessed it
row reverse sets the main axis direction from right to left which results in the flex items being
placed from right to left if i refresh
you can see the items are now placed in the reverse order item 1 starts at the end of the
container the third alert value is column
when you set flex direction to column the main axis flows from top to bottom
the items will be stacked on top of each other refresh the browser
and you can see the items flow from top to bottom item 1 at the top and item 9 at the
bottom finally we have column reverse
which stacks items in the reverse order if i
refresh you can see that item nine is at the top and item one is at the bottom
so the flex direction property sets the direction of the main access thereby controlling how the items are placed in
the container possible values are row which sets main axes from left to right
row reverse for right to left column for top to bottom and column
reverse for bottom to top
