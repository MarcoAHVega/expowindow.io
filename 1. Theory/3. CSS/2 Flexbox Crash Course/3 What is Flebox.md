# what is flexbox

all right with these points in mind let's get started

what is flexbox

the css flexible box module or simply known as flexbox is a one-dimensional
layout model

it allows you to design flexible and efficient layouts
align and distribute space among items in a container

to put it in non-technical terms
flexbox helps you arrange elements in a web page with ease

now why was this introduced well before flexbox there were four
layout modes and we had a look at all of them in the css crash course

block for sections in a web page

inline for text

table for two-dimensional table data

and positioned for explicit position of
an element

these layouts however did not provide enough flexibility

we had to find all kinds of hacks to get the layout just the way we wanted

working with floats trying to vertically align content create equal height columns

well they were kind of a nightmare

the flex layout on the other hand provides a lot of flexibility
with flexbox we can arrange items left to right right to left top to bottom or
bottom to top

and at the same time control the spacing alignment
and order of items in the container

and to be honest it has sort of become a
must-know for front-end developers in 2022.

if you're comfortable with html and css
flexbox is the logical next step for you

all right now that we understand the
what and why of flexbox let's dive into understanding the different concepts
