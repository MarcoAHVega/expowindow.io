# flex

all right the next property applicable to a flex item is the flex property
which is a shorthand for flex grow flex shrink and flex bases
although we can specify the three properties individually the recommended way is to use the flex property
since we have already covered the three properties i'll walk you through slides for this property
i recommend you play around with it in code when you get the time now flex accepts three values separated
by a space the first is flex grow the second is
flex shrink and finally flex bases you can see that it is much simpler and
easier as well by default flex property has a value of
0 1 auto 0 for flex grow which implies the items
will not grow to fit the container one for flex shrink which implies the
items will shrink when necessary an auto for flex bases which implies the
width of the items depends on their content the flex property can be specified using
one two or all three values try experimenting with different values
and you'll get a good understanding of the flex property
