> First application

1. public folder

(The /public/ folder will contain public files that we want to be available just the way they are (like our /static/ folder in the previous lessons).)

- Create a `/public/` folder.
- In /public/, create an `index.html` file
- in this file create an Emmet `html boilerplate`.
- Change `<title>` to `First React Application`
- Create a `<div>` in the `<body>` and give it and ID of `root`

1. src folder

(The /src/ folder will contain source files that will be processed before getting output as classic web-friendly content; typically, our JavaScript.)

- Create a `/src/` folder.
- In /src/ create an `index.js` file.
- In this file, `import createRoot from react-dom/client`:

```js
import {createRoot} from 'react-dom/client'
```

- createRoot, as its name suggests, will create the root of a ReactDOM application and we can pass it the DOM Element that will be replaced by this root (the `<div>` with the root ID in our case):

```js
import {createRoot} from 'react-dom/client'

const root = createRoot(document.querySelector('#root'))
```

- We now need to render it with the render() method:

```js
import {createRoot} from 'react-dom/client'

const root = createRoot(document.querySelector('#root'))

root.render(<h1>Hello React</h1>)
```

3. Start it

- In the terminal (in the folder), run `npm run dev`
- The first time we start it, the script might ask us for `the targeted browsers`.
- Press `Y` to use default browsers and the script will save that default value in package.json so that it doesnâ€™t ask us every time we start coding.
