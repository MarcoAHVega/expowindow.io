# Section 1: Introduction

1. Introduction

   - > Gutenberg

     Back in 2018 with WordPress five, WordPress released, Gutenberg

     Gutenberg is a block editor, and it replaced the classic editor, which was more like a sort of a word processing type system.

   - > full site editing

     in January 2022, WordPress released version 5.9 and version five point nine allowed you to use

     Gutenberg for posts and pages, but also introduced full site editing.

     It's often abbreviated to FSE.

     Everything that you see on your web page is now editable.

   - > So why is that a big deal?

     Well, you're in full control of the design of your website, how it looks, how it feels you are in

     total control, whereas previously in previous versions of WordPress, the theme took over the header,

     the footer and a lot of the design elements like typography and colors.

   - > So full site editing basically means you can design your own theme.

# Section 2: Gutenberg Block Editor

3. Overview

   - > I just want to introduce this idea that web pages are made up of elements arranged vertically and horizontally on the page.

   - > In Gutenberg, we'd use a group and we would grouped together the different blocks that make up that group.

   - > So go and have a look at any website and you'll be able to divide it up into rows and columns.

   - > These rows and columns are our friends, and it's the basis of how we will design a page or post in WordPress using Gutenberg blocks.

1. Interface (start Practice)

- > 1. Create/open a site named `Full Site Editing Tutorial`

  - For now, I want to just go over the Gutenberg interface in posts and pages.

  - It doesn't matter whether you go to click or not, add a new post or a new page. The editor is the same.

- > 2. So let's just `create a new post` that we can have a look at.

  - this is now the Gutenberg editor for a post.

- > fullscreen mode

  - The sidebar that we had before is missing.

  - If you want the sidebar there while you're working, click on the little three buttons up at the top here and you see that full screen mode is checked.

  - In reality, it's actually quite good having full screen mode when you're working in the Gutenberg editor because it gives you more space for your design.

- > 3. add a title of `Demo Post` and save it as a draft

- > Across the top here we have a `toolbar`

- > the `List View`

  - This lists all of the blogs that you are using.

- > patterns

  - you can use these patterns as templates for your own site and the elements, and then just go in and edit the individual blocks that make up those patterns to customize them for your needs.
