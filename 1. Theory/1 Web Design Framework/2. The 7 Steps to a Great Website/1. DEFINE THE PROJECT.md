1. DEFINE THE PROJECT (354)

   - > Define WHO the website is for.

     Is it for yourself? For a client of your agency or your freelancing business?

   - > Define WHAT the website is for.

     In other words, define business and user goals of your website project (See lecture on UX)

     - Business goal example: Selling premium dog food

     - User goal example: Finding high-quality dog food for good price

   - > Define a target audience.

   - Be really specific if possible and if it
     makes sense for your website (this can come from your client)

   - Example: “Women, 20 to 40 years old, living in Europe, earning over 2000€/month, with a passion for dogs”
