    - > RESPONSIVE DESIGN

      - Design technique to make a webpage adjust its layout and visual style to any possible screen size (window or viewport size)

      - In practice, this means that responsive design makes websites usable on all devices, such as desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones.

      - It’s a set of practices, not a separate technology. It’s all just CSS!
