# 17. HTML5 Semantic Tags

HTML Semantic Elements: (4 points)...

- Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

- A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

- Examples of non-semantic elements: `<div>` and `<span>` - Tells nothing about its content.

- Examples of semantic elements: `<form>`, `<table>`, and `<article>` - Clearly defines its content.
