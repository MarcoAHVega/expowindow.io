# 11. Links, Images & Attributes

Practice: on a new boilerplate

**a link is is represented with an `<a></a>` tag**

> The `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

> The most important attribute of the `<a>` element is the `href` attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

> By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

> An unvisited link is underlined and blue
> A visited link is underlined and purple
> An active link is underlined and red

> If the `<a>` tag has no `href` attribute, it is only a `placeholder` for a hyperlink.

> A linked page is normally displayed in the current browser window, unless you specify another target.

> every link needs an href attribute because that's the location that you're linking to.

_external link_

1. Write an external link to Google.com "Click For Google"...

```html
<!-- External link -->
<a href="http://google.com">Click For Google</a>
```

> if we want to open in a different browser tab we can use `target` attribute and `_blank` value...

2. make this link to open in a new browser window..

```html
<!-- External link -->

<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Click For Google</a>
```

_how to put an `<a></a>` tag in a new line_

3. Now if I want this on a new line I could put a line break or I could just wrap them in a paragraph tag, because a paragraph is actually a block level element...

```html
<!-- External link -->
<p>
  <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Click For Google</a>
</p>
```

_how to create an internal links_...

4. Create an internal link to 04_typography.html "Typography"...

```html
<!-- Internal link -->
<p>
  <a href="/04_typography.html">Typography</a>
</p>
```

**The `<img>` tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page.**

> Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages.

> The `<img>` tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

> The `<img>` tag has two required attributes:

> `src` - Specifies the path to the image

> `alt` - Specifies an alternate text for the image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed

> Also, always specify the `width` and `height` of an image. If width and height are not specified, the page might flicker while the image loads.

> To link an image to another document, simply nest the `<img>` tag inside an `<a>` tag

1. Create a local image...

```html
<!-- Local image -->
<img src="/images/sample.jpg" alt="My Image" />
```

2. set the width and height of an image in the html...

```html
<!-- Local image -->
<img src="/images/sample.jpg" alt="My Image" width="200" />
```

3. create a Remote image...

```html
<!-- Remote image -->
<img src="https://source.unsplash.com/200x200/#building" alt="My Image 2" />
```
