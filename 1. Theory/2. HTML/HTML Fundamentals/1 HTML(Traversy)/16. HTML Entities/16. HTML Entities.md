_HTML Entities_: (4 points)...

Some characters are reserved in HTML.

Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.

If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags.

Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.

Non-breaking Space...

A commonly used entity in HTML is the non-breaking space: `&nbsp;`

A non-breaking space is a space that will not break into a new line.

Two words separated by a non-breaking space will stick together (not break into a new line). This is handy when breaking the words might be disruptive. (10 km/h)

If you write 10 spaces in your text, the browser will remove 9 of them.

To add real spaces to your text, you can use the `&nbsp;` character entity.

Tip: The non-breaking hyphen (`&#8209;`) is used to define a hyphen character (â€‘) that does not break into a new line.

```
<!-- Non breaking space -->
<p>Hello, my name is &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brad</p>
```

_grater than angle bracket (&gt;) (&#62;)_

_less than angle bracket (&lt;) (&#60;)_

_copyright symbol (&copy;)_

_registered trademark symbol (&reg;)_

_cents (&cent;)_

_pound (&pound;)_

_yen (&yen;)_

_euro (&euro;)_

_spades (&spades;)_

_clubs (&clubs;)_

_hearts (&hearts;)_

## _diamonds (&diams;)_

Also if you want to display something in like computer code font you can use the code tag...

_computer code tag (`<code></code>`)_

```
<code>
&lt;?php echo 'Hello' ?&gt;
</code>
```

_keyboard tag (`<kbd></kbd>`)_ is similar
