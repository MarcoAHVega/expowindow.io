<!-- 
& 11 Git Tips - How to Handle (and Avoid) Merge Conflicts

(66.1)   
- in this lesson we will `learn how to work with a team of other developers without letting merge conflicts` and get stresses out. 
   
   Here's `an overview` of what we'll cover. 
   
   First we'll answer the question of `what is A merge conflict.` 
   
   Next we'll learn `how to fix or resolve A merge conflict.` And 
   
   finally we will learn `how to avoid a lot of merge conflicts in the first place.` 
   
   Let's start at the top with number one. 
   
(66.2)   
- `What is a merge conflict. `
   
      Well we know that get is really good at taking two versions or snapshots of a project in squishing or merging them together. Right 
   
      so we've used the get merge command many times to do just that. So 
   
   `most of the time` git can automatically merge our code from one commit state into another without any problems. 
   
   But `if we ask get to do the impossible and read our minds` we'll run into something named a merge conflict. 
   
   Let me show you `a couple examples` of what I'm talking about. 
   
   So `first we'll see an example of a successful merge` that saves the day. 
   
         And then secondly we'll see an example of a failed merge that runs into a conflict. 
   
   Let's imagine we have an html file in our repo on github and let's say we have two developers on our team working on this project. John and Jane. 
   
   Let's imagine John pulled down the master branch to his computer and begins working on a few changes. 
   
   Let's say he adds a few new list item elements `to the end of the unordered list`. 
   
   Now imagine at the same time that John is working on those changes. Jane also pulls down the master branch to her computer and before John can push his master branch back up to get hub Jane is able to quickly add a new list item elements `to the very beginning of the unordered list` and she successfully pushes her master branch back up to get hub. 
   
   This would mean that John's copy of the master branch is now outdated compared to the copy on good hub. 
   
   So when John tries to push his master branch to get hub he'll see an error message that his push failed because his Ribault is outdated. 
   
   Now `at that point all John needs to do to fix things is run a get pull to pull in the latest changes from get hub and then it can automatically merge his outdated commit with Jane's recent commit `
   
   now if you're in the command line and get is trying to perform a merge you might be wondering what keys you're supposed to press. 
   
   So from this screen we want to push the escape key and then type a colon and then W Q And then press enter. 
   
   After that successful automatic merge John is now free to push his master branch up to get up get is able to save the day and merge for us here because the lines of code that each team member added are different from each other 
   
   one added to the beginning of the list and the other added to the end. 
   
(66.3)   
- However let's imagine it's a new day. And on this day John pulls down the master branch to his computer and begins to work on adding his thoughts and opinions about each number. 
   
   So he edits the four line to say that `four` is a good number. He edits the five line to say that` 5` has been bad luck in my life 
   
   and before John can finish his work and push his master branch up to get Herb. Jane also starts working on her master branch and she too is adding her opinions on numbers 
   
   so she edits the four line to say `four` is unlucky and she edits the `five` line to say five is my favorite number and Jane is faster than John. 
   
   So let's imagine that Jane is able to push her branch up to get hub before John finishes his work. 
   
   So again when John does finish his work and tries to push it to get up his push will fail because his repot is now outdated 
   
   but this time when John tries to fix things by running a get pole get will not be able to automatically merge and save the day. 
   
   Instead John will run into a merge conflict. `The conflict is that John and Jane both want to commit different changes to the same lines of code `
   
   and `get. Has no way of knowing who to listen to John or Jane.` So in this case a computer can't decide for us 
   
   as a human being. We need to step in and manually make a judgment call and choose which code to use for those lines. 
   
   So the command line here is telling us which files have conflicts. So let's open this file up in our text editor and see how easy it is to resolve a merge conflict 
   
   so the Get system automatically added a few lines of code to the file. This line this line and this line. 
   
   So first head is the commit that John tried to push and following that are the matching lines of code from James recent comment. 
   
   So we just need to do two things we need to remove the label lines that get added to the file and we also need to decide which conflicting winds to actually use. 
   
   So let's make a judgment call. Why don't we say that John is right about the number four and Jane is right about the number five. 
   
   So let's delete the line of code from Johns commit that was about five and let's delete the line of code from Jane's commit that was about four. 
   
   And then let's also delete these lines that get automatically added 
   
   and once we've cleaned up the file we just save it and then jump over to the command line and we can simply stage and commit our changes just like we normally would. 
   
   And because we resolved the conflict John would now be free to push his master branch up to get up 
   
   so you can see that emerge. Conflict is nothing to be afraid of. You just open up the file and make a judgment call. 
   
(66.4)   
- But in a perfect world we wouldn't run into conflicts in the first place. So now let's change gears in this lesson and review a few best practice tips we can follow to avoid merge conflicts in the future. 
   
(66.5)   
- Tip number one is to run the get pull command as often as possible. 
   
   If you're working with a team of other developers you want to constantly be pulling in their commits from the server so that you're working with the latest code 
   
   you want to make this part of your routine so running get pool just becomes a habit. 
   
   Any time you sit down to work on your project before you actually edit any files run a get pull. 
   
   So if you get into work at 8 AM first thing running get Paul. If you get called into a few meetings or phone calls and you don't actually get to work on the project until after lunch well after lunch. Run another get pool. 
   
(66.6)   
- Tip number two and this probably goes without saying. But simply communicating with your team can go a long way. 
   
   Talk with each other about who is responsible for which changes and which parts of the project. 
   
   Be aware of what each team member is working on for that day or week and you don't need to go overboard and waste a ton of time chatting about what you're working on. 
   
   But you'd be surprised. Even just having a general idea of what each person is working on will put you in a position where you are far less likely to edit the same lines of code within the same file at the same time. 
   
   And that means less conflicts. 
   
(66.7)   
- Tip number three is to get everyone on your team to agree on whitespace settings in your text editors. 
   
   So for example if I jump into my text editor and I press the tab key we need to ask ourselves what exactly did my text editor do to create that space or that indebt. 
   
   Is that a single tab space character or is it actually just for individual space bar spaces or to individual space bar spaces. What is it. 
   
   Well in the bottom right corner of my text editor I can customize what happens when I push the tab key so I can choose to use space bar spaces or actual single character tabs spaces and I can also choose the tab width so whether I want to indent a little or a lot you get the idea. 
   
   Now you want to make sure that everyone on your team uses consistent settings. 
   
   Otherwise get will notice differences in you and your teammates code that you didn't even intend. 
   
   All right 
   
(66.8)   
- let's move on to tip number four. Tip Four won't help you avoid conflicts outright but if you're working on a feature branch Tip 4 will help you deal with any potential conflicts before it's time to actually Merge feature branch back into Master. 
   
   So let's imagine you're working on a new feature. Let's say on January 1st you create a new branch off of master named home page feature. 
   
   Let's imagine this branch is taking you a couple of weeks to finish. So on January 15th you finish your feature and you want to merge your branch back in the master. 
   
   However your home page feature branch is based off the January 1st state of the master branch 
   
   and since then your teammates have been making all sorts of updates to the master branch. Which means when you try to merge your feature branch into Master you could very well run into conflicts 
   
   and we typically want our merges into Master or our pool requests to not have any conflicts. 
   
(66.9)   
- So tip number four is to change the way we think about the get merge command. 
   
   Let's stop viewing it as a one way street where we only merge feature branches into Master 
   
   Let's view it as a two way street where we can also merge the master branch into our feature branches. 
   
   So in our example between January 1st and January 15th every couple of days why don't we just pull down the latest copy of the master branch and while we have our feature branch checked out let's merge master into that branch. 
   
   If we do this often enough we will likely avoid any conflicts 
   
   and even if we do run into a few conflicts we can deal with them now so that when it comes time to actually merge our branch into master the process will be smooth and painless 
   
   and that will actually wrap up our top four tips for avoiding conflicts. 
   
(66.10)   
- Obviously there are a ton of other strategies out there but these four are simple enough to follow and they will make a huge difference. 
   
   Now in our next lesson we will be changing gears big time. We will learn how to get more job interviews and more importantly once we've gotten an interview we want to be sure that we interview well 
   
   it should be a ton of fun. Let's keep things rolling and I will see you in the next lesson.
