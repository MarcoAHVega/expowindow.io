& 3 how to checkout between different branches
~ step 1 : git checkout count-to-ten
todo> So our next step is `to switch over to the new count-to-ten branch`

   * or in git terminology we want to checkout the count to ten branch. 
   ^
   git checkout count-to-ten

   (29.7)
   ? So now we are working with the new branch.

~ step 2 : work on the branch
todo> Let's jump to our text editor and `OPEN UP index.html` 
      
   -let's `create an unordered list` and begin counting to 4. 
   
   -`save this` and check out the browser.

~ step 3 : git status - git add - git commit all changes
todo> Let's go ahead and `commit this change.` 
   * So let's run 
   ^
   git status

   * Let's go ahead and add this file to our staging area.
   ^
   git add -A 
   
   * So get add everything get. Status. All right. 
   ^
   git status

   * So this staging area looks good to me. `I'm ready to commit` 
   ^
   git commit -m 'Counted to 4'


(29.8)
~ step 4 : git checkout master - end work on it 
todo> I can switch back to my master branch 
   ^
   git checkout master
   
   * And now that we are working with the master branch we see that `our count to ten list is gone` 

   * So let's imagine that we are working on the master branch for a few hours
   
(29.9)
~step 5 : git checkout Count-to-ten
todo> and switch back to that branch. So 
   ^
   git checkout Count-to-ten
   
   * we see that our list is back let's start counting (working) again.

~step 6 : add and commit
todo> we commit those changes
   ^
   git add -A
   ^
   git commit -m 'completed the count to 10'
