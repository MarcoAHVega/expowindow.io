& 7 I want to show you another way to merge branch. `We can actually have github perform the merge for us`.

   todo> So let's go ahead and `create another brand new branch as another example`. (Currently we are on the master branch )
   ^
   git branch count-to-15

   todo> let's go ahead and `switch over to that new branch` or check out the new branch. 
   ^
   git checkout count-to-15

   * And in this new branch let's `expand this list (in the html) to count up to 15` (maybe we could only get to 13 today)

   todo> we `commit that change before` we head out (you can actually stage and commit your files in one move)
   ^
   git commit -am 'counted to 13'
   ~ step 1
   todo> before we go home for the day we can actually `push this individual branch up to github`
   ^
   git push origin count-to-15
   ~ step 2
   todo> now if I jump over to GitHub.com and check out the page for my travel site repo, We can click on commits.

   ? we don't see our latest commit here because we are currently looking at the master branch. 
   ~ step 3
   todo> So if we click this and `switch it to the new count-to-15 branch` (in the github site) that we just pushed, there is our latest commit. 
   ~ step 4
   todo> Now let's jump back to our text editor and `complete this feature`. So 14 15 this new feature is complete. 
   ~ step 5
   todo> Let's go ahead and `commit our change`
      ^
      git commit -am 'Completed the count to 15.'

   ? So this new count to 15 feature is complete, Which means it's ready to be `merged into the master branch`. 
   ~ step 6
   todo> But this time around instead of using our command line to perform the merge let's just push the count to 15 branch up to Github 
      ^
      git push origin count-to 15

   ?  and let GitHub handle the merging.
   ~ step 7
   todo> if we jump back to github and visit the home page for this repo we see that github added this row that reads "your recently pushed branches:".

   ? and on the far right we see a "compare and pull request" button.
   ~ step 8
   todo> Let's go ahead and click that, so on this screen we are creating a `pull request`, a pull request is basically a request to merge one branch into another. 

   ? So we are considering the master branch our base and the count to 15 branch is the branch that we want to merge in.

   * Now often when you use get hub you will be working together with other developers on a team.
   ~ step 8
   todo> so this is your chance to write a bit of a comment so you could say "Hey team in this amazing branch I counted to 15." 

   ? And you would usually `assign this pull request to someone else on your team, That way they can do a bit of a peer review on your code and make sure that things truly look good before merging it in the master.
   ~ step 9
   todo> So let's just go ahead and `assign this to ourselves`

      todo> `click "assignees" and then you can just click your own name

      todo> and then click `Create pull request`

   * here is the `review screen` for that poll request that we just created.
   ~ step 10
   todo> we have the authority to scroll down and `click merge pull request.`

      todo> We can go ahead and click this `confirm merge button`

   * and we see that the pull request was successfully merged and closed.  

   * Once a branch has been merged in the master there's not much of a reason to keep that extra branch around.

   ? It's a good practice to keep your repo clean and `delete unnecessary branches`  (on github) 
   ~ step 11
   todo> So let's go ahead and `click delete branch`. Perfect.

   (29.15)
   ~ step 12
   todo> So all we need to do is `pull in the latest copy of master from GitHub down to our machine`.
   ^
   git pull origin master 
   
   ? and now our local copy of the master branch has the latest code.
