# MoodBoard

⏩ 🟢 MOODBOARD ⤵ / - Clone Images

- using the Eagle app, make images of all section rows and component rows for Desktop (1440px), Tablet (768px) and Phone (375px)

- arrange all the images inside there corresponding frames in the figma/2-Workflow/Moodboard/Clone images page

- don't worry about the grid for now
