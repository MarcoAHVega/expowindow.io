# Project Overview

> 1. the starter project folder

> the css folder

- Contains a `style.css` file
- All we have is this comment here where I put `the three green colors` that we used for the branding of the webpage

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/
```

> the img folder

- all the `images` that we're gonna use for the page
- and also the `background video`
- and all these `background images`
- and `logos`
- and the `hero image` for the first section

> our HTML file

- It's just a simple bare bones structure where we can start adding stuff to our body

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

        <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:100,300,400,700,900" rel="stylesheet">

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/icon-font.css">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
        <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="img/favicon.png">

        <title>Natours | Exciting tours for adventurous people</title>
    </head>
    <body>


    </body>
</html>

```

- So you see I already `included the style CSS` here

- I already gave it `a title` and `a favicon`

- and I also already `included the Lato font`, so the Google web font.
