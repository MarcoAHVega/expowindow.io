      <div class="logo-box">
        <img src="img/logo-white.png" alt="logo" class="logo" />
      </div>

      <div class="text-box">
        <h1 class="heading-primary">
          <span class="heading-primary-main">Outdoors</span>
          <span class="heading-primary-sub">is where life happens</span>
        </h1>

        <a href="#" class="btn btn-white">Discover our tours</a>
      </div>
    </header>
  </body>
</html>
```

- So the button will be `an anchor element`, so a for now, with an href of nothing

- we need to give it a `class of btn` but at the same time, I'm giving it another class,`btn-white`, because we're going to have multiple buttons on the page

- and the text on this button, is `Discover our tours`

> 2. let's now start styling the button element (the :link, :visited and :hover pseudo classes)

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.7;
  color: #777;
  padding: 30px;
}

.header {
  height: 95vh;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(126, 213, 111, 0.8), rgba(40, 180, 133, 0.8)),
    url(../img/hero.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: top;
  position: relative;
  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75vh, 0 100%);
}

.logo-box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 40px;
  left: 40px;
}

.logo {
  height: 35px;
}

.text-box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 40%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  text-align: center;
}

.heading-primary {
  color: #fff;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  margin-bottom: 60px;
}

.heading-primary-main {
  display: block;
  font-size: 60px;
  font-weight: 400;
  letter-spacing: 35px;

  animation-name: moveInLeft;
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-out;

  /*
  animation-iteration-count: 3;
  animation-delay: 3s;
  */
}

.heading-primary-sub {
  display: block;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 700;
  letter-spacing: 17.4px;
  animation: moveInRight 1s ease-out;
}

@keyframes moveInLeft {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(-100px);
  }

  80% {
    transform: translateX(10px);
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translate(0);
  }
}

@keyframes moveInRight {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(100px);
  }

  80% {
    transform: translateX(-10px);
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translate(0);
  }
}

.btn:link,
.btn:visited {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  text-decoration: none;
  padding: 15px 40px;
  display: inline-block;
  border-radius: 100px;
  transition: all 0.2s;
}

.btn:hover {
  transform: translateY(-3px);
  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

.btn:active {
  transform: translateY(-1px);
  box-shadow: 0 15px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

.btn-white {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #777;
}
```

- So with this (`.btn {}`) we select a button element but since it's a link, I'm sure you already know that we should do it like this (`.btn:link {}`)

- So this here is the :link pseudo-class And pseudo-classes are a special state of a selector.

- we use pseudo-classes to style elements under a special condition, like when a user hovers an element, or when a checkbox is clicked or if we want to select a last-child, and many other possibilities And it's a very important concept that we're going to use all the time

- But there's also the visited state (`.btn:link, .btn:visited {}`) So this is the state when the user has already clicked on the button once before and then sees the button again

- we don't want the link default visited state, we want the visited state to look at exactly like the link state, so the normal state of our links and so we just put them together

- Now the first thing that we're going to do is to say that we want the text to be uppercase, `text-transform: uppercase;`

- We want there to be no text decoration `text-decoration: none;`

- Now remember that we're going to have multiple colors for the button and so in the white button, the text will be this dark gray, And so that's something that we have to do in this `.btn-white` class

- and so here we're going to have a `background-color` of white (#fff) and the `color` should be gray (#777) as we already used before

- Now we also want some `padding` around the button, a padding at the top and at the bottom of `15 pixels` and left and right, `40 pixels`

- So this button here is right now an inline element because it's simply text, but we should `display inline-block` And this way the box model works on this element as if was just a normal block element, So we should always do this if we want to give some paddings or some heights or width to elements

- Another thing that we want is the button to be in the middle of this box and this is an inline block element and so it's treated as if it was text

- And so if it's text and we want it to be at the center of this box, all we have to do is to go to the `.text-box`, and set its `text-align` property to the `center`

- let's also add here some white space between this heading element (`.heading-primary`) and the button, And in this case we just want margin at the bottom, we say `margin-bottom` and let's say we want `60 pixels`

- Now let's take care actually of the hover state. So `.button:hover {}`, so another pseudo-class to select a different and special state of this element.

- The first thing that we want to happen when hover is for this element to move up We use transform, such as we did before. So you see `transform translate` Y (the upsilon axis) `-3 pixels` in this case.

- Now when we clicked it, remember it looked a bit different. So it's the active pseudo-class So it's the active state `.btn:active {}`

- and this time we're only moving it 1 pixel up `transform: translateY(-1px);`

- let's actually add the rounded corners. So `border-radius, 100 pixels` on the initial state

- So now all we have to do is the small animation, Now in this case All we have to do is use the transition property on the initial state `transition: all .2s;` So this is already the shorthand version of the transition.

- we have to just specify which properties we want to animate. And if we're not really sure, or if we don't want to write them out, we can simply say `all` So in this case, all the properties are enabled to be animated. Then we can also specify a time that we want. Let's say that we want `0.2 seconds.`

- So on the initial states, we say that there can be a transition basically on all the properties and then on the hover, so here we say, how it should look like in the hover state and in the active state and then the animation is going to happen.

- Now all we have to do is to add the box shadow and this also when we do the hover `box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);`

- Now remember, when we click on the button, so when it's `active`, we want the shadow to look smaller and so to give the impression that the button is closer to the page and so further away from the user. `box-shadow: 0 15px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);` So let's decrease this here to `5 px` and then we also want it less blurred. So let's say `10 pixels`
