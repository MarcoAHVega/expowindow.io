# 7. Building the Header - Part 2

> 1. Adding the logo image

- what I'm gonna do now is to add first a DIV, and then inside that DIV is where I'm gonna put an image

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:100,300,400,700,900"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/icon-font.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" />
    <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="img/favicon.png" />

    <title>Natours | Exciting tours for adventurous people</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header class="header">
      <div class="logo-box">
        <img src="img/logo-white.png" alt="logo" class="logo" />
      </div>
    </header>
  </body>
</html>
```

- the image is actually an inline element, and so I think it's a better practice to first have a small container where this image is inside, and then position that container to where we want the image and the container to be

- a DIV with a class of logo-box And then in here, I'm going to put the image

- remember that the `alt attribute` is to describe the image for SEO, so Search Engine Optimization, but also for the case that somehow the image fails to load, then on the website instead of the image appears this text

- I'm also going to `add a class and call it just logo`

> 2. positioning the logo-box

- So first the logo-box

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.7;
  color: #777;
  padding: 30px;
}

.header {
  height: 95vh;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(126, 213, 111, 0.8), rgba(40, 180, 133, 0.8)),
    url(../img/hero.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: top;
  position: relative;
  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75vh, 0 100%);
}

.logo-box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 40px;
  left: 40px;
}
```

- one good way of doing this is to use `absolute positioning`

- And we can then use `top, bottom, left, and right properties` to put the image exactly where we want it to be

- There has to be some kind of reference from which we start to count 40 pixels to the left, and 40 pixels from the top And `that reference is a parent element`, which `has to have its position set to relative`.

- so we should go to `.header` and set its `position to relative`.

> 3. styling the size of the logo image

- let's just specify the size of the image itself.

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.7;
  color: #777;
  padding: 30px;
}

.header {
  height: 95vh;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(126, 213, 111, 0.8), rgba(40, 180, 133, 0.8)),
    url(../img/hero.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: top;
  position: relative;
  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75vh, 0 100%);
}

.logo-box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 40px;
  left: 40px;
}

.logo {
  height: 35px;
}
```

- So we say `height 35 pixels` And then the width we'll scale accordingly

> 4. adding the primary heading using 2 spans for 2 lines

- So back to the HTML, right after this logo box we will have our primary heading

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:100,300,400,700,900"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/icon-font.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" />
    <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="img/favicon.png" />

    <title>Natours | Exciting tours for adventurous people</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header class="header">
      <div class="logo-box">
        <img src="img/logo-white.png" alt="logo" class="logo" />
      </div>

      <div class="text-box">
        <h1 class="heading-primary">
          <span class="heading-primary-main">Outdoors</span>
          <span class="heading-primary-sub">is where life happens</span>
        </h1>
      </div>
    </header>
  </body>
</html>
```

- I'm going to use the `h1` element, and call it `heading-primary`

- We want all of this text And so we must somehow divide this text in tow lines

- We are going to use this span element. And this span element is perfect for this because remember that a span is simply to style some text different.

- And so we can just put two span elements in here, one for each part.

- One for the top `Outdoors`, class="heading-primary-main"

- and one for the bottom `is where life happens`, class="heading-primary-sub"

- and we're actually going to put all of this `in a container div`, because we're gonna add something more into this box later on, So, let's just call it `text-box` for now

> 5. styling the primary heading

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.7;
  color: #777;
  padding: 30px;
}

.header {
  height: 95vh;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(126, 213, 111, 0.8), rgba(40, 180, 133, 0.8)),
    url(../img/hero.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: top;
  position: relative;
  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75vh, 0 100%);
}

.logo-box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 40px;
  left: 40px;
}

.logo {
  height: 35px;
}

.heading-primary {
  color: #fff;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

.heading-primary-main {
  display: block;
  font-size: 60px;
  font-weight: 400;
  letter-spacing: 35px;
}

.heading-primary-sub {
  display: block;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 700;
  letter-spacing: 17.4px;
}
```

- So the first thing that we want is the `color` to be white

- Now another thing that we want is to text the uppercase, so we say `text-transform, uppercase`

- Next, what we want to do, is to put this on top, and this below it, I think the best way is to `display them both as block level elements`

- Also this text should be bigger, and this one smaller, So let's set this one to `font-size 60 pixels`, Give it a `font-weight of 400` And then we also give it the `letter-spacing of, let's say, 35 pixels`

- And now similar specifications down here for `the sub-part` of the H one. So a `font-size` in this case of 20 pixels, `font-weight` of 700 as well. headerAnd the `letter-spacing`, I'm going to put it to 17.4 pixels

> 6. the easiest way to center anything in CSS with transform, top, and left properties

- And with that formatted, we should now find a way to make this displayed exactly in the center

- Now of course, this should stay exactly in the center no matter what the screen size is

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.7;
  color: #777;
  padding: 30px;
}

.header {
  height: 95vh;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(126, 213, 111, 0.8), rgba(40, 180, 133, 0.8)),
    url(../img/hero.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: top;
  position: relative;
  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75vh, 0 100%);
}

.logo-box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 40px;
  left: 40px;
}

.logo {
  height: 35px;
}

.text-box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 40%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}

.heading-primary {
  color: #fff;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}

.heading-primary-main {
  display: block;
  font-size: 60px;
  font-weight: 400;
  letter-spacing: 35px;
}

.heading-primary-sub {
  display: block;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 700;
  letter-spacing: 17.4px;
}
```

- So, `text-box` is what we're gonna style next. I'm putting it here just to `follow the natural order of the HTML`

- once again, we're going to use absolute positioningS, `position absolute`

- Now about the top, and the left They will have to be a bit different. we start by saying `top 50%`, and `left 50%`

- Now what we wanna do in order for this to be exactly in the center, is to shift this just a little bit, So another way, what we want is to translate this entire box using the `transform: translate() property`

- And now we just need to specify how much we wanna translate on x and on y. And what we want is `-50% for both`.

And that's because these -50%s are now `no longer in relation to the parent element, but of the element itself.`

- Now because of this wedge that we cut out here, it looks a bit weird And so instead of shifting it down 50%, maybe we can just do 40%. We stated the `top to be 40%`, and then that should fix our problem.
