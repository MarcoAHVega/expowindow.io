- One thing that we have to do though, is to `Identify our first block` here. That's the `header` here,

- so the header is obviously a block in the BEM system because it is a stand-alone component that is meaningful on its own, and so is the block

- so all the elements that are inside it should also have the header attached to them

So this `logo-box` here, it can only really exist here in this header, so it's and element Because it's a part of a block but it has no standalone meaning.

So now we should start adding the `header__` to the element. So, header and now remember, it's double underscore to separate the block from the element. So header\_\_ is the block and logo-box is the element.

And the same thing here for our logo, so we call it `header__logo`. Because this logo with this exact size, and this exact image, it only just exists here in the header.

The same goes, of course, for this `text-box`. So `header__textbox`, simply because this text box is a part of the header and it doesn't make much sense to use it anywhere else.

Now as `for this heading-primer here, things are a bit different actually`, because we could treat this as a block on its own.

Imagine that we wanted to use this H1 element somewhere else, imagine we had another page but without a header like this one, and we wanted to use this primary heading, we could, of course, do so and so this one here is a stand-alone block.

Now as to these two here, what do you think about them? They are called `heading-primary-main` and `heading-primary-sub`. So what these two are, is they are actually `modifiers` of the heading-primary

Because they simply create a slightly different version of this heading-primary class of the block so what we do is we put two dashes here. `heading-primary--main` `heading-primary--sub`

So remember, block and then if we have a modifier, we do dash dash and then the name of the modifier.

If it's an element, then we use underscore underscore and then the name of the element after that.

Same thing down here, a `btn` is, of course, a stand-alone component so we can consider it a block in the BEM notation, because we're gonna use this button throughout this entire page.

Now here, these two can be considered flags as well `btn--white` `btn--animated` such as we had before and so we use double dash on both of them, cause this is still a button, a button but they do simply create different versions, different modifications, and that's why they're called modifiers, and that's actually all

> 2. let's just go back to the style and change it here as well.

```css

}

.header__text-box {

  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  text-align: center;
}

.heading-primary {
  color: #fff;
  text-transform: uppercase;
  margin-bottom: 60px;
}

.heading-primary--main {
  display: block;
  font-size: 60px;

  letter-spacing: 35px;

  animation-name: moveInLeft;
  animation-duration: 1s;
  animation-timing-function: ease-out;

  /*

}

.heading-primary-sub {
  display: block;
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: 700;
  letter-spacing: 17.4px;
  animation: moveInRight 1s ease-out;
}

@keyframes moveInLeft {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(-100px);
  }

  80% {
    transform: translateX(10px);
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translate(0);
  }
}

@keyframes moveInRight {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateX(100px);
  }

  80% {
    transform: translateX(-10px);
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translate(0);
  }
}
@keyframes moveInBottom {
  0% {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(30px);
  }

  100% {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translate(0);
  }
}

.btn:link,
.btn:visited {
  text-transform: uppercase;
  text-decoration: none;
  padding: 15px 40px;
  display: inline-block;
  border-radius: 100px;
  transition: all 0.2s;
  position: relative;
}

.btn:hover {
  transform: translateY(-3px);
  box-shadow: 0 10px 20px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

.btn:active {
  transform: translateY(-1px);
  box-shadow: 0 15px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

.btn--white {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #777;
}

.btn::after {
  content: '';
  display: inline-block;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 100px;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index: -1;
  transition: all 0.4s;
}

.btn--white::after {
  background-color: #fff;
}

.btn:hover::after {
  transform: scaleX(1.4) scaleY(1.6);
  opacity: 0;
}

.btn-animated {
  animation: moveInBottom 0.5s ease-out 0.75s;
  animation-fill-mode: backwards;
}
```

the first block is the `.header` so we change this to `.header__logo-box` and here we had `header__logo` and `header__text-box`

next block is the `heading-primary` so here just a dash missing `.heading-primary--main` another dash, here everything stays the same `.heading-primary--sub`

then we have the `button` block, so here another dash to create this different, `.btn--white` and `.btn--white::after` and here the `.btn--animated`

So that's actually it, so our code is now converted to BEM.
