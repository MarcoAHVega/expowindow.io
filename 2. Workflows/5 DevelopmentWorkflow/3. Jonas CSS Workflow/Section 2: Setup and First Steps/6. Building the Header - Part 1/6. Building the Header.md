# 6. Building the Header part 1

> 1. the (basic) html for the header section

- let's write the html for the header element. (For now, we're only gonna concentrate on the background image and on making its shape)

- so We're gonna use the HTML5 header element And we're also going to give it a class called header, Just for now, let's simply put some text here.

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <link
      href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato:100,300,400,700,900"
      rel="stylesheet"
    />

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/icon-font.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css" />
    <link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/png" href="img/favicon.png" />

    <title>Natours | Exciting tours for adventurous people</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header class="header"> some text... </header>
  </body>
</html>
```

> 2. How to perform a basic reset using the universal selector

- Now the first thing I'm gonna do is to perform a basic reset using the universal selector

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

- The universal selector `*` will select each and every element on the page, and then apply these declarations here to it.

- This `margin: 0; padding: 0;` allows us basically to start clean, without the browser adding any margins or paddings, that we don't want, to our elements.

- Without this `box-sizing: border-box;`, any paddings and borders are added to the height or the width of an element which really isn't helpful for us

> 1. how to set up project-wide font definitions

- let's set some overall font properties for the entire webpage

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.7;
  color: #777;
}
```

- we using the `body` selector because the properties related to font are usually inherited, so we're using the power of inheritance here

- we set the `font-family` on the body element, (which is basically the parent element of all the other elements) Then this font family will get inherited by all the child elements of the body

- it's a `better practice`, Everything related to font, we always specify it here in the body selector.

- I can use `Lato` because I already included it here `in the html`. I included Lato with the font weights of 100, 300, 400, 700 and 900.

- We're using `16 pixels` here for now, but we're actually going to change this later to use a better technique, but for now, let's go with these pixels.

- So basically `line height 1.7` means that it's 1.7 times bigger than the predefined line height, that we would have without this.

- we can set here the overall text `color`

> 4. how to style the header Hero image (with a background image - not ideal for performance)

- With that in place, let's start formatting the header element And remember it has the header class.

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.7;
  color: #777;
}

.header {
  height: 95vh;
  background-image: url(../img/hero.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: top;
}
```

- basically we say that at every point, the height of this box, of this element, should be `95% of the viewport height`. (Now we could put 100 here, then the element would always be exactly the same height as the viewport, but I chose to go with 95 to make it not 100%, but only almost 100%.)

- The `background-image` that we want is here in the image folder. It is called hero, And we specify an image by writing url and then specifying the path to the image

- what `cover` does is that whatever the width of the viewport, or the element, it'll always try to fit the element inside of the box.

- whatever the viewport size is the `top` of the image always stays at the top of the container.

> 5. how to add a gradient overlay on the hero image

- Next up, we want that nice green `gradient` over the image.

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.7;
  color: #777;
}

.header {
  height: 95vh;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #7ed56f, #28b485), url(../img/hero.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: top;
}
```

- to specify `gradients`, we always use the background-image property.

- We already have the background image property here with the image. We simply `specify a second one`.

- we want the `gradients` to stay on top and so it actually has to be first background image that we specify

- another parameter that we can specify in the linear gradient is basically to where the gradient should go. We can say `to right`

> 6. how to make the gradient transparent by changing the opacity

- we have to change the opacity of these colors In order to do that, I can actually use the built in color picker in VS code

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.7;
  color: #777;
}

.header {
  height: 95vh;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(126, 213, 111, 0.8), rgba(40, 180, 133, 0.8)),
    url(../img/hero.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: top;
}
```

- on the css file, `hover over the hex color` and then click the hex value in `the color picker` to change it to a rgb value

- then pull down the slider until it gives me an opacity of `0.8`

- and now we have an `rgba` value

> 7. Adding a white frame around the entire page

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.7;
  color: #777;
  padding: 30px;
}

.header {
  height: 95vh;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(126, 213, 111, 0.8), rgba(40, 180, 133, 0.8)),
    url(../img/hero.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: top;
}
```

- All we have to do is to put a padding around the entire body, `Padding 30 pixels`

- The body element contains the entire webpage and so if we set a padding here, then this padding will get applied on the entire webpage.

> 8. How to clip parts of elements using the new clip-path property

- And for that, we use the really modern CSS property called clip-path

```css
/*
COLORS:

Light green: #7ed56f
Medium green: #55c57a
Dark green: #28b485

*/

* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
  font-size: 16px;
  line-height: 1.7;
  color: #777;
  padding: 30px;
}

.header {
  height: 95vh;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, rgba(126, 213, 111, 0.8), rgba(40, 180, 133, 0.8)),
    url(../img/hero.jpg);
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: top;
  clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75vh, 0 100%);
}
```

- what we're doing here is to specify a polygon in which the image, or the element, will still be visible

- We use the polygon function

- And in here we define a bunch of coordinates which define this polygon

- All we need to specify these four corners in order to obtain this polygon

- we could also specify it as in pixels or in any other unit that we want

- And we're gonna start here at the top left corner and then move clockwise

- top left corner (x=0 y=0) `clip-path: polygon(0 0, x y, x y, x y);`

- top right corner (x=100% y=0) `clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, x y, x y);`

- bottom right corner (x=100% y= 200px) `clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75vh, x y);`

- bottom left corner (x=0 y= 100%) `clip-path: polygon(0 0, 100% 0, 100% 75vh, 0 100%);`

- Now you can do lots of different things with this and there's actually a very cool tool which is called Clippy https://bennettfeely.com/clippy/
