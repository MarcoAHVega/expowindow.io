# 18. Converting px to rem: An Effective Workflow

> 1. how and why we use rem units in our project

> 2. a grate workflow to convert pixels to rem in the easiest way<!--^-->

we want an easy way to change all the measurements on our page (when we hit a break point) with one simple setting (the global font size)

Setting the root font size in the html element to 10 px

change (set) all, or let's say most, of our pixel measurements to rem.

we can still improve this by setting our set font size to a percentage (10 divided by 16 is 62.5%)

use the power of inheritance in the box-sizing property

update this universal reset to also select all of the after pseudo-elements and also all of the before pseudo-elements.
