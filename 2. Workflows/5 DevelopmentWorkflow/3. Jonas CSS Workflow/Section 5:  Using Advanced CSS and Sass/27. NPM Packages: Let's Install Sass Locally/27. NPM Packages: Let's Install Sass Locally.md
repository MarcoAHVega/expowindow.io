# 27. NPM Packages: Let's Install Sass Locally

> 1. install SASS on our local computer

- there are several ways to do this, but I found that the easiest one is to just use an NMP package called Node SASS

- Now in order to use and share these packages we need some kind of tool to install and to manage them. And that's where the Node package manager, or NMP comes in

- the first step to actually get started with this is to install Node on your computer

1. usually the first thing that we always do in a new project is to `create a package.json file` Which basically will contain the definitions of our project and where NMP will write the packages that we use

```js
mpm init
```

2. install our SASS compile as one of our developer dependencies

```js
npm install node-sass --save-dev
```
