# flex-flow

all right let's proceed to the fourth flex container property which is flex flow
it is a shorthand for flex direction and flex wrap
let's comment height of 400 pixels flex direction
and flex wrap instead define flex flow
by default the flex flow property is set to row and no wrap
which is the default value of the individual properties the first value is the flex direction
and the second value is the flex wrap property value if i refresh
and you can see once again the items are laid from left to right and there is no wrapping of items
you can type any combination of the possible values and the layout will adjust accordingly
let's go with flex flow set to row reverse
and wrap refresh
and you can see the layout in the browser the flex direction is from right to left
and when i reduce the browser width the items are wrapped into the next row
so the flex flow property is a shorthand for flex direction and flex wrap
the first value is flex direction and the second value is flex wrap
all possible combinations of the two properties work just fine
