# setup

- > some very simple html and css

to get us started with flexbox i have
set up some very simple html and css that i am now going to walk you
through

- > a folder

- i have created a folder called `flexbox crash course` and within the folder i've created an `index.html` file and a `styles.css` file

- > the html is pretty standard

```html

```

the head tag contains what you would normally find and a link to the css file

within the body we have a parent div tag with a class called container
this parent container has nine div tags as children

each div has a class flex item and also a class specific to the item
number item 1 item 2 till item 9.

- > in the css file

```css

```

i've set margin to 0 on the body element
and on the container class i've added a thick black border

on the flex item class

i've added a font color white

a font size of 1.5 ram
padding of one rem

and have also center aligned the text

for items 1 through 9 i've set a different background color so as to
visually separate each item in the browser

- > the html and css code can be found on my github page

in the crash course 2022 repo i'll make sure to include a link in the
description

once you clone the repo or download the code
if you open the html file in the browser

you should be able to see this layout

you can see we have nine items enclosed within the container that has a solid black border
