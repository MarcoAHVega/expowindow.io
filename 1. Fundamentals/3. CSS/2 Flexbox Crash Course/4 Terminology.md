# terminology

- > understanding the terminology is essential

we first need to start off by understanding the terminology in flexbox

trust me when i say this the next few minutes you spend understanding what each term means
will decide how easy it is to understand the flexbox properties

understanding the terminology is essential to this course so please make
sure you pay attention

- > flex container and flex items

when we talk about flexbox we mainly have two entities

a parent container which we term as the
flex container

and the immediate children elements which we term as flex items

if you take a look at some sample html the parent div is the flex container

and all the children divs are the flex items

- > the main axis and the cross axis

now we also deal with two axes when working with flexbox
the main axis and the cross axis

by default the main axis runs left to
right

and the cross axis is perpendicular to the main axis and runs top to bottom

- > main start, main size and main end

the start point of the main axis is termed as main start

and the end point
is termed as main end

the length from main start to main end
is called the main size

so we can say that the flex items flow
from main start till main end and take up the main size as the length

- > cross start, cross end and cross size

similarly with cross access we have cross start cross end and cross size

we can also change the direction of the main and cross axis by changing how the
items are laid out in the container

we will talk more about that later in
the course

- > understanding flexbox is basically getting familiar with the properties associated with the flex container and the flex items

nothing fancy you just learn it like how
you learned css

know what properties exist and how they work
