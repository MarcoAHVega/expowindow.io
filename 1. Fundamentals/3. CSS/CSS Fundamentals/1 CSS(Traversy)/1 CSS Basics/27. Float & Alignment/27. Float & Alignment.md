---------------------------------------
*(27.1) how to center your your content*...
 
to do that is pretty easy:  
 
* We just need to *wrap our elements with a container* element with class or I.D.  

* And then we need to *add a width to it*  
 
* and *set the margin to auto.*  
  
* If we set the margin to auto it's going to add the same amount of margin on both sides pushing it into the middle...

```
.container {
width: 960px;
margin: auto;
}

```
we go back now you'll see it's in the middle.  

And the orange part in the sides is the margin in. Notice it's the same. It's even on both sides. That's what happens if you do margin auto. 

*(27.2) if you want to move it down a little bit*...

Now if you want to move it down a little bit if you want margin on the top and bottom you could do something like this.   
 
```
.container {
width: 960px;
margin: 30px auto;
}
```


*(27.3) use max-width for responsive design*...

You want to do all you can to make your site look decent on mobile devices and we're gonna get more into this later.  
 
But if I go down like this like if we were to view this on a mobile device you can't even read the text.  
 
You have this scroll bar which is just horrible.  
 
We want that all the text to display here so to fix that is very simple. All we have to do is go from width to using max-with...

```
.container {
max-width: 960px;
margin: 30px auto;
}  

```  
 
So if I save that we go back now all the text is there. Regardless of the screen size. And then once I get to 960 it's going to it's going to stop. 

* you should always use max-width on your containers


So next thing I'm going to do is just kind of *style these boxes a little* bit...

and the body I'm just going to throw in a body style

Let's do *font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;* 

and then I'm just going to add a *line height of 1.4 REM*...

```
body {
      font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
      line-height: 1.4em;
    }
```

Let's let's style the box class a little bit...

so for box we'll do background light gray  
 
and border one pixel solid dark gray  
 
padding 20 pixels.  
 
And let's do margin bottom 15 pixels.  
 
Let's take a look at that.

```
.box {
      background: #f4f4f4;
      border: 1px solid #333;
      padding: 20px;
      margin-bottom: 15px;
    }  
```  
 
So all of our boxes now have 20 pixels padding they have the border the the background and some margin to push the. The other ones down.

*(27.4) text-align property*  
 
So before we get into floating I just want to look at the text-align property

So let's just target the paragraph...

```
.box p {
   
}  
```  
 
by default it's aligned to the left...

```
.box p {
text-align: left;
}  
```  
 
But let's say we wanted that aligned to the right...

```
.box p {
text-align: left;
text-align: right;
}  
```  
 
 If we want it to the center we could do center...

```
.box p {
text-align: left;
text-align: right;
text-align: center;
}  
```  
 
(and it's just overwriting. I can leave these whatever the last one is that's going to overwrite the other ones.)  
 
* text align center is used often.  
 
* And I could put text align center on the div if I wanted this and if I wanted everything within it to be centered as well.  
 
And then we could also do justify...

```
.box p {
/* Text Align */
text-align: left;
text-align: right;
text-align: center;
text-align: justify;
}  
```  
 
* justify we'll just make the edges all even


*(27.5) floats are not ideal anymore*...

* just keep that in mind just keep in mind that we're learning floats but it's not something that you're going to use use that much or that you should use that much.

*(27.6) float to the left*...

So let's say that we want to take Box 2 and 3  
 
we want Box 2 to float to the left.  
 
So we want box 3 to be kind of a side bar more narrow box.  
 
Let's jump in and let's target Box 2 which has an idea of Box 2 and let's say...

```
#box-2 {
float: left;
}
```

Now if we do just that it doesn't do much you'll see that it's kind of it's kind of put up right on top of box 3 but  
 
*(27.7) you want to add a width when you're floating something*...

* You're probably going to want to use percentages  
 
Now the container that the boxes are in is 960 pixels Max-width  
 
so what we can do is let's use a percentage of 70 percent...

```
#box-2 {
float: left;
width: 70%;
}
```

*(27.8) float to the right*...

and then we'll take box 3 and let's float that to the right and let's say we want the width to be 30 percent. Okay. Because obviously 70 and 30 is 100 percent of its container...

```
#box-3 {
float: right;
width: 30%;
}
```

*(27.9) set the boarder-box property*...

We'll go back and we have an issue it's not it's not fitting  
 
Now *the reason for that is because we didn't set the board or box property.*  

* So this is another pain  in the neck for for floating. *It adds to the width.*  
 
* So we have to actually add a box sizing property on the asterisk...

```
* {
box-sizing: border-box;
}  
```  

So once I do that it takes away that it doesn't add the padding to the actual widths.

*(27.10) lessen the percentage so the elements fit better*...

So now it fits but they're right on top of each other so what I would do in this situation is probably just lessen the percentage.  
 
So instead of seventy four a box to let's change it to 68 so it doesn't go all the way over...

```
#box-2 {
float: left;
width: 68%;
}  
```  
 
and there we go.

*(27.11) we're not going to get into responsiveness yet*  
 
Now this isn't going to look right. If we make this smaller but we're not going to get into that yet we're not going to get into responsiveness yet.  
 
Though the Web site the hotel Web site we build we will be using media queries and stuff to make it responsive.  
 
* So I mean this is how we would do it before flexing and CSX grid came out.

*(27.12) if we add another div below this Doesn't look right*

Now I just want to show you guys that if we add another div below this and we'll just call this box for.  
 
* Doesn't look right. So it's basically put behind it. It doesn't push it down under the floated elements because the floated elements have to be cleared.  
 
*This is another pain in the neck when it comes to floating.*


*(27.13) if you use floating you're gonna have to clear them. In most cases*...
 
So what we would do are one thing we could do is add a class a utility class and put it up here. I'll call it clr for clear and we'll set the clear property to both because we want to clear the left and right floats that we just created...

```
.clr {
clear: both;
}
```

and then we would have to put it right under where the float is which is under 2 and 3 OK. So div class clear...

```
<div class="clr"></div>  
```  
 
Now if we go back box four is pushed down.  
 
* so remember if you use floating you're gonna have to clear them. In most cases.
