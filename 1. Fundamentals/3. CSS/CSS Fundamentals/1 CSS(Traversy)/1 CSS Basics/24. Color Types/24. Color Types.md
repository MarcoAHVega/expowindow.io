_(24.1) color name type_  
(on the h1) And the first type is is a _name_...

```
h1 {
color:red;
}
```

_(24.2) rgb value_
So the second color type that we can use is in rgb value.

So for the h2 let's say our rgb()

and this takes in three things three values red green and blue.

And each value should be anywhere between 0 and 255.

So if I do zero that means that the value for Red is zero...

```
h2 {
color: rgb(255,255,255);
}
```

_(24.3) hexadecimal or hex value_

- hexadecimal or hex which is base sixteen number and it pertains to the composition of a certain color in the RG B space.

- So it's always going to start with a number sign and it's gonna be six or three characters
  that are gonna be letters letters and or numbers for numbers it's gonna be it is either
- zero to nine or four letters it'll be a two F

so all zeros is gonna be black and then all F's is gonna be white...

```
h3 {
color: #f4f4f4;
}
```

So just like our G.B. it's gonna give us just a color based off of the values of red green and blue.
