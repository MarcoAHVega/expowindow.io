& 59. Navbar & Lightbox Effects
   OK so now we want to give this the effect where it's now bars transparent when we scroll down. Then we get the background. So what we'll do here is in our HD PML we're gonna start off with a class of nav bar and top because it's gonna be transparent at the top. Right. So we'll go into our style and let's say class nav bar. And if it has a class of top Then we're gonna set the background we're going to set the background to trends parents. So if I save that and we go now we have a transparent background. Now it's going to stay transparent which we don't want. We can't even see it if it goes over white. You know white background. So we need to add a little bit of JavaScript so I'm going to put it right in the index age to normal down at the bottom here. So let's go right below the footer right above the body tag and let's put in script tags. So I'm not going to explain you know explain this front to back because this is not a javascript course. You guys can just copy this if you want but I'll explain it briefly so I'm gonna grab the nav bar and put it into a javascript variable called now bar and we do that with document dot get element by D. And that nav bar div has an I.D. of nav bar. So I'm just gonna grab that. I'm also going to initialize. Actually no we'll just we'll do this for now. So then we want to take window dot on scroll which is an event. So we're saying well basically when we start scrolling then we want to run a function. OK. And then we want to check where we are on the page in terms of scrolling so we can say if the window dot and then page y offset because we want to check where we are on the y axis which is the vertical axis. If that is greater than 100. So if we scroll down past 100 pixels then let's take our NAV bar and for the classless. So basically the classless we're gonna go ahead and remove the class of top and remove the class of top is where we make the you know the transparent background. So we're going to remove that else. So if we're basically above 100. So for less than 100 then we're gonna take the nav bar and we're going to take the class list property and the add function. So basically we can add a class here. We're going to add top back. So just this code here should give us that effect. So you'll see soon as I scroll down past 100. Then we get that background. Now I'm going to take it a step further and give it this bounce effect and we're doing we're going to do that using the transform property along with translate and I haven't explained that yet. So this might be a little confusing. I do get into this later on in the course. So you don't have to do this if you don't want to. But I will show you how I did that. So I'm going to go back to my javascript here and I'm going to initialize a variable here called scrolled and set it to false. So basically what this means is we haven't started scrolling yet and then down here after we go ahead and we we remove the top class and make it so it has a background. We're going to say if not scrolled then we want to set the nav bar dot style because we can set direct CSF properties from here. We're going to set the transform and we're going to set that too on we're going to set that to translate why and what translate. Why is it does as it moves things along the y axis. So up and down we're going to set that to negative 70 pixels so that it gets basically gets pulled up. So let's see if we can demonstrate this. Yeah. So when I go down and I hit that one hundred it goes up see that it just I mean it just kind of disappears actually because we don't have a transition where it's going up slowly. So if we want it to go up slowly we can add a transition which is also something I haven't gotten into yet but we are going to dive into this stuff later. So in our style sheet on our NAV bar here I'm going to add a transition say transition of one seconds and let's do ease in actually. Is that what I want to do. Yeah. We don't even need X so let's do a half a second let's just say transition zero point five seconds and I'm going to explain like I said later on I'll explain this stuff. This is just kind of a bonus that I figured I'd add on. So now when I scrolled down see that how it goes up smoothly that's because I added that transition. So it's getting it's going up negative 70 pixels remember the height is 70 pixels so now it's going up and it's disappearing. Now let's go back to our javascript so it went it went up 70 pixels. Now we want to wait a very short amount of time like 200 milliseconds and then bring it back down by setting translate why back to zero so we can do that using a function called set time out. So set time out actually takes in a function and then it takes as a second parameter the time that we want to wait to run this function which will be 200 milliseconds. And all I want to do is set this back to zero which I'll put it in its original position and then I'm just going to set that scroll to value to true because we've already scrolled down. Okay. Else then we're still going to do the same thing but we're gonna set scrolled to false and if you like this kind of stuff I would definitely recommend my 20 projects course we do stuff like this. So now let's go ahead and scroll and you can see that what happens is when we hit 100 we get the background also it translate on the y axis up in 200 milliseconds later which is very quick. It comes back down because we set it back to translate 0. And when we get to the transform translate and transition stuff later on it'll make more sense. Even though it might not make much sense now but that gives us that effect. Now for the smooth scrolling because right now it just kind of pops down to the area. I'm going to use a J query solution. So we're going to just go to let's search for J. Query C D and now we could download J query and include it in our project. But I'm just going to use a C D N meaning that we're going to load it from their content delivery network. So let's grab the mini fied version so we can just copy this script tag right here and let's put that in our HD hymnal. So we want to go above our custom script and just paste that in. So that'll bring in J. Query and then I'm just going to paste in this smooth scrolling block of J. Query so I'm going to go under my custom window scroll here and paste a sin I should have auto format enabled let me just check something real quick. It's a format on save I thought I had that enabled. There you go. All right. So that fixed how that's formatted. So basically we're just grabbing the nav bar and when we click any link in it it's going to look at the link. It's going to look at the hash. So you know we have hash about hash home and it's going to scroll to that and it's also going to go a little bit above it. So that that fix now bar doesn't cover it. So let's try this out. We're going to go back to our home page here. Let's click about. And now you'll see it will go down to that section and it doesn't cover it like like it did before because we set it to be 100 pixels above where it's actually supposed to go. OK. So I mean that's how we implemented how I implemented that those effects for the nav bar. There is a ton of other ways. I mean there's other libraries you could use without J query but this is a really simple solution. So if you want to add this to your other you know your blog page and stuff because right now if we go to blog we don't have that functionality we don't want the smooth scrolling because none of these point to anything else on the page. We just want the you know the effect the transparency effect. So to implement that we would just go to our blog HDL and add top add the top class to our now viral it's added on the Post page as well. So where are we now. Bar out the top. And then we just want that little bit of JavaScript right here so we don't want the J Cory stuff. We just want this so blog H AML we'll go down to the bottom and put in a script paste that in and then post and of course you could put this in a different file if you want script and paste that into now. That should work if we go to blog. You see it's transparent at the top and then we get that. If you go to the Post page same thing all right. So I think we're pretty much there. The last thing to do is the Lightbox. Now this is good. We're actually going to implement a library called lightbox 2. So it's this right here. So here's some examples. Let's see so we're gonna have to download it. So if we go to the get hub let's grab right here. This is clone or download we're gonna download the zip and let's open that up so lightbox 2 dev and there's some stuff we need to bring over to our projects. So I'm going to just open up my projects if I can find its ok. So here's our project edge ledger and we're gonna take inside of dist. We need this stuff here so in CSX in our CSX folder let's bring over light box mend CSX so we'll grab the mini fied version and then let's see we're going to create a new folder called J.S. and in this j s folder we just need to grab. Let's see and this does require j crew as well so we're gonna grab the mini fied version here of lightbox that should be all we need. We don't need this stuff here. We already have J query included. Now there are some images to you know scroll through and stuff like that. The X image so we're gonna put that right in are these right in our image folder ok. And then we need to include the script in the CSX in our index each Timo. So let's go back into our index age to normal and we only need to do this on the home page because we're not using this anywhere else. So up at the top here let's add another C Ss reference and this is gonna go to C Ss slash light box men dot CSX and then for the javascript let's go all the way down to the bottom so let's see we have our custom. We have J. Query and then we have our custom script. We're gonna want to put this right after the J Cary reference so right here. Let's say a script coal and sauce and we want to point to J.S. slash and then lightbox Minjae s all right. Now to implement this we actually have to do some stuff to the cases because that's where we want to use this. So we need to wrap these cases in in links because we need to point to the actual image. So this first image here. Let's put a link and let's see how do we want to do this. We don't need any classes or anything but we need to point to the actual image for one. So we'll just grab this and let's put this image one inside this link to image one and then we just need to add a couple attributes. So we want to say data dash light box and we're going to set this to cases which is like the category. So if you want to be able to scroll through all the images they all have to have the same value for data Lightbox. And then if you want some text we can say data dash title and let's just grab this text here and put that inside here. OK. So we have this link going to the image with these two attributes around the image. So I'm just gonna save this and let's try it out for the first one. So if we go down to cases and we click on this. There we go. Now we'll have to do the same thing for the rest of the images. So what I'll do is copy this link at least the first a tag go to the next image paste that we want to make sure we add the ending a tag change this to two because we want to obviously point to the same image and we can leave this. We want to leave the same value for that. And I mean you could put different text here if you want but it really doesn't matter. It's not real content. So we'll do the same here. This is going to be three. And we'll wrap that. OK next one paste that in this is going to be for make sure you put the ending tag on. Then we have cases five and a tag Pops. This will be six. Just make sure you point to the same image that you're surrounding the link in the image. Make sure they match seven a tag and then the last one will be eight. There we go so we'll save that. And now you should be able to click on all of these you should also be able to scroll through because they all have the same data lightbox equals cases. And that's what puts them all in the same group. All right. So that's it we're done. And hopefully you enjoyed this project. I know there was some stuff that you know in this in this last section that we didn't go over yet but you'll learn more about stuff like transform and you know pseudo selectors and stuff like that later on. All right. That's it. Thanks. I will see you in the next section.
