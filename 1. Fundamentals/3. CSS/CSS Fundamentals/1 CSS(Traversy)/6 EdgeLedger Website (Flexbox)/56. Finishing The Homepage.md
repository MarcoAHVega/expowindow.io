& 56. Finishing The Homepage
   OK. Now we're gonna do the team sections. I'm going to go under the blog and we can actually copy since we're using the header and all that we can copy the cases and paste that in here. So say team. So we're gonna give this. We actually. Yeah we'll give us an idea of team. Even though I don't think we have it in the menu but let's go ahead and add a class of team and let's see we're not using flex grid but we are going to use Section padding and section header and we'll just change that content up. So each four will say who we are. Let's change this. Say our professional team and we'll keep that text. Now for the the images we're actually gonna use. We can get rid of this row because we aren't using flex grade we're using flex items. So same thing we did with the icon. So we'll have a div with an image and it's gonna be images slash team person 1 underneath the image. Let's do H 4 and John Doe and then paragraph This will be the the person's position. So President we're gonna have three of these. So this will be person to say say Jane Doe and we'll say Vice President Person Three say Steve Smith final male creative what my names and let's say say marketing head. All right. So just doing that if we take a look. To me looks pretty good because we already have those classes in place. Now I do want to round the corners of these images make these kind of circular so in our style sheet I'm just gonna say. Class of Team image. Set the border radius let's do 50 percent and there we go. So that's it for the team. So for the what's next. The contact section here. We're gonna use the same layout as this. And this actually probably copy this because we're gonna have the image on the left. So it's left right left. So let's let's just copy the loops copy the solutions so we'll grab this and put that right here. So this is the contact section so we'll say contact and let's give it an I.D. of contact in the class and we're gonna be using this flex columns here as well. So we want to row the column column one. The image however is going to be contact. And then this content. I mean we're going to keep the column too. I'm actually going to use BGP light and we want to turn this into a form so we can get rid of the headings and stuff like that. So everything within column two. And then let's create a form give it a class of callback form and action. We'll just keep that empty for now. And then in the form let's go ahead and add a form say form control class. So every label and input will be wrapped in a form control class let's say label for name and the inputs let's say input. We'll given an idea of name and we'll give it a name of name. And then the place holder set that to name. Now this isn't going to actually submit anywhere by default I might do something later on I believe in the next section. We did do a peach pea script. I might change that because like I said I'm redoing this this project but I do have a way where we we put this to a shared host and then we add a simple peach pea script to submit the form but I might change that up I don't know. So let's copy this down three times because we're going to have name email we'll change the type of this to email as well and then change that to e-mail the I.D. and then the place holder actually place holder should say like enter email and this should say enter a name and then this one is gonna be phone text phone I.D. phone and then place holder will say enter phone OK. And then we just need a submit button. So under this div here let's say input and we can say call and submit give us type submit we'll say send given an I.D. of submit and let's give it a. Let's give it a class of b t n all right. So if we take a look at this the image is not showing up for some reason. Images. I have 2 J pings all right. So we have the image. So the the layout is good but the form looks horrible so we obviously want to change that. So we're going to style it. I also want a header right above the form or heading I should say. So let's do an H H2 and we'll say request callback. OK. So as far as as far as the form goes let's go ahead and style that. So in style CSX say callback form and has a class of callback form. And we're going to set the width to 100 percent of its container some padding on the top and bottom. And then let's go ahead and style the label. So callback form label by default labels are in line but we want the label to be block so that it's on a new line. So let's say display block and then just give it some margin on the bottom to push the input down. So the margin bottom five pixels. And then each form control. So callback form form control. OK. So that wraps the label in the input. I just want to add a margin bottom of 15 pixels to push push everything down. OK. And then the input themselves so that those are really important to style because they're very ugly by default. So let's say input callback form input set the with two 100 percent we'll set the padding to four pixels and let's give a height of 40 pixels and the border will do like gray one pixel solid and the button. So we'll say callback form B10. I just want to I want to add some extra padding to that. So we'll say 12 pixels top and bottom and then push down. I want to push the button down so let's say margin top 20 pixels. OK so that looks pretty good. Now when I click inside of it we get this blue outline if you want that that's fine. But I can show you how we can change that color so we can actually do that by. Let's go right here and say callback form inputs input and we want the focus state and then we can set the outline color and we'll set that let's set it to the green. So this right here OK so now if we go in and click now we get that green outline and you can set its outline zero if you don't want it at all. So the last thing is the footer so we might as well do that because it's pretty simple. So we'll go ahead and add the HD hymnal so we actually want to go under the main because the footer isn't part of the main. So it's a footer. And let's give footer a class of footer and also big dark because I want to give it the dark background and then we're gonna have a div called social. OK so this is where our social icons will go. We'll have a link around them which would go to you or like you know your profile and let's put an icon here so f a b. You need to use a class of f a b for social icons and then let's do F.A. Facebook and then we'll copy this down a few times so we'll do Facebook. We'll do Twitter YouTube and LinkedIn and then under that div we're gonna have a paragraph with copyrights. We'll use an HMO entity so Ampersand copy semicolon 2020 and we'll say edge ledger. OK so that's what it's going to look like. So obviously we have a little bit of styling to do here. So let's go to style CSX OK and let's add a class of footer we want to display this as a flex box and I actually wanted to be a column. So flex direction column because all we're doing if we look at the final version here we have we're gonna have it in a column but center it in the footer if you wanted to you could have a row and you could have the icons over here and the text over here. But I think that this looks fine if we do it this way we can't even see the icons right now because we need to change the color. So let's go back here and let's say footer. So any links obviously we want to be able to see those and then back up here let's center everything so a line item center justify content center text align center and let's set the height of the footer to two hundred and regardless of the height it should be centered vertically and horizontal. All right. Let's see. So the icons are really small. So I'm actually going to add to those the class of f a 2 X.. So we'll just grab that okay. And then I also want to add some margin between them because they're very close together. So what I'll do is I'll say save footer and then inside the social div just in case they're not links and you put divs or something else let's just say anything within there we want to set margin right to 30 pixels. And then on the hover say footer so footer on the link cover as I want to change the color to that green color. So if we put that in here and let's take a look good and if we hover over these we get that green color. OK. So that's the. The base styling of our landing page. So I think what I want to do in the next video before we do the other two simple pages is make this responsive because if I make this smaller it's not too bad. I mean this looks fine. The now bar obviously does not this is to squish together. This is to. We would just want to stack all this stuff. So it's not going to be too difficult. So in the next video we'll go ahead and get to the media queries.
