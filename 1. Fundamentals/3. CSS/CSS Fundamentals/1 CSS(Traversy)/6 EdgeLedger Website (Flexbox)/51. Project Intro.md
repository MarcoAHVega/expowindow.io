~ Section 7 EdgeLedger Website (Flexbox)

& 51. Project Intro
   All right so we're gonna take everything that we've learned up to this point and we're gonna build a project called Edge ledger which is a Web site for a fictional financial company. And this is actually a remake if he took this course already before April of 2020. You might notice the site looks different. I actually have the older version open up right here which you can see definitely doesn't look as good. The font the the the big showcase image is actually too long takes up too much space. It should you know right when you scroll it should end. So he didn't really do the overlay the way that I would want to the nav bar is it doesn't look as good and it's just there's not that much here. We did use Google Maps and unfortunately about a month after our release the course Google the Google API required you to put a credit card in and a lot of people complained about that. So I removed that part of it. So if we take a look at the new version you can see it looks much cleaner. If we start to scroll down the nav bar actually goes from being completely transparent to having a transparent background or a slightly transparent background. And we're going to add some javascript for that effect towards the end of the project. So under the main showcase area we have some fun awesome icons we're going to style we're gonna use flex blocks to align everything we have this area here the solutions area we're going to have a lot of utility classes so for buttons and backgrounds and even FLEX FLEX items and stuff like that. We're going to create utility classes that we can reuse throughout the Web site and that's kind of how I like to build Web sites and you guys is basically like a mini framework and then down here we have our cases which is like an image gallery or even going to implement a small lightbox library so we can click on an image we can pull that up and we can actually scroll through them and we have some text down here as well. OK. So underneath that we have the blog section which again is similar to this right here. So we'll have a lot of utility classes that will be able to reuse then we have our team area. We have their request callback form and then we have the social icons in the footer here. And if we click on the read our blog it'll actually take us to a new page with some blog posts that have that same kind of format with the with the boxes here. And if we click on read more it will actually take us to one more page that will create which is just a very simple Post page. OK. And it's completely responsive so we'll go ahead and open up our device toolbar and we're going to add media queries so that this looks good on mobile screens as well. OK. So the nav bar fits nicely in there everything's nice nice and stacked. Even the light box will open up right in there. So yeah that's we'll be building now in the next section after we actually build this project. I show you how we can deploy this to a shared host. And you'll notice that when we deploy it'll be the old version but everything is the same everything still applies as far as deployment even the form I show you how to create a very simple page P contact form so that we can actually make this form at the bottom work. OK. So everything will be the same but you'll notice that it'll be the old version of the Web site. OK. So that's it. Let's go ahead and get started.
