& 60. Extra - Adding a Favicon
   Hey guys one last thing before we wrap this project up I wanted to show you how to create a fab Akon so you might see these icons up in the tab sometimes. So I actually have in our project and images I have a P and G file. However I'm gonna convert it to an icy old file and there's a tool that I use to do that which is called Dynamic drive. So if we search for a dynamic drive fab Akon I don't know the exact you are Al so it's right here. The Fab icon generator and I've used this for years. So if we just go ahead and choose a file and I'm going to choose that PMG file and click Create icon and download the fab icon and it's gonna be this ICAO file so I'm just gonna go ahead and grab that and grab my project and we'll put that we're gonna put it right in the root not in the images folder I'm going to put it right in the roots so drag that over. Now we have that ICAO file and it also gives us the tag we just want this link tag we can go ahead and copy that and I'm going to put that in my index each tomorrow which I don't think I do have it still open. So I'm gonna go up to the head here and put this right above my style sheets so we'll paste set in and then if we go back to our site and we just need to reload the cache. So if you're on Windows I believe it's shift and F five. If you're on a Mac it's going to be shift control ah we're reload and now you can see up here we have the little fab Akon and of course you can use any image you want. So I just wanted to throw that in it's something I forgot to mention and that's it. Thanks I'll see you in the next section.
