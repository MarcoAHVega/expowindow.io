All right so in the last video we looked at how to create a grid and how to deal with the grid-template-columns property  
 
Now `there's also a grid-template-rows property`  
 
Now we're going to we're going to look at that  
 
we're also going to talk about the `implicit rows`

*1. for this we are going to need again* *a div with a class of grid* with *6 divs inside with a class of item*  
 
then we need to *style the items* with:  
  
* padding  
* background  
* border  
* text align  
* font weight  
* and font size  
 
then we *take our grid div and apply display grid*

*2. So remember with Flexbox we have a row and a column,* *We can set flex direction to either row or column*  
 
*with the grid we also have rows and columns*...
 
* So I'm going to go ahead and set the grid to rows  
* and we want 3 rows of 1 fraction, 2 fractions, and 3 fractions...

```
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr 3fr;
   }

.item {
    padding: 3rem;
    background: #f4f4f4;
    border: #ccc 1px solid;
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 1.4rem;
  }
  -------------------------------------------------
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="item">Item 1</div>
    <div class="item">Item 2</div>
    <div class="item">Item 3</div>
    <div class="item">Item 4</div>
    <div class="item">Item 5</div>
    <div class="item">Item 6</div>
  </div>  
```  
So as you can see there they're vertical  
 
and *the fr value is the row height*  
 
And the first one is 1fr, Second is 2fr Third is 3fr  
 
But notice the ones that are remaining where we don't add a specific value for  
 
they're just going to stay the same they're all going to look like this. This is actually called the *implicit grid* or *implicit rows* because we didn't we didn't manually set them, *except for the padding: 3rem;*

*3. there's actually another property we can use if we want to set these to something different and that is*...

`grid-auto-rows:`  
 
we can set this to let's say *we want the rest of them to be 3fr* as well...

```
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr 3fr;
    grid-auto-rows: 3fr;

   }

.item {
    padding: 3rem;
    background: #f4f4f4;
    border: #ccc 1px solid;
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 1.4rem;
  }
  -------------------------------------------------
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="item">Item 1</div>
    <div class="item">Item 2</div>
    <div class="item">Item 3</div>
    <div class="item">Item 4</div>
    <div class="item">Item 5</div>
    <div class="item">Item 6</div>
  </div>  
```  
 
And now the rest of them are all 3fr  
 
Now unlike flexbox *the grid is multi-dimensional*  
 
so we can we can use `grid-template-rows:` along with `grid-template-columns:`

*4. So just to show you that let's* *set grid columns* and let's say we want to do 2, So we'll say *repeat 2 and let's do 1fr*...

```
.grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: 1fr 2fr 3fr;
    grid-auto-rows: 3fr;

   }

.item {
    padding: 3rem;
    background: #f4f4f4;
    border: #ccc 1px solid;
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size: 1.4rem;
  }
  -------------------------------------------------
  <div class="grid">
    <div class="item">Item 1</div>
    <div class="item">Item 2</div>
    <div class="item">Item 3</div>
    <div class="item">Item 4</div>
    <div class="item">Item 5</div>
    <div class="item">Item 6</div>
  </div>  
```  
 
And now you can see that we have our 2 columns which is just to 1fr  
 
So the columns are even  
 
But then we also have our rows which are 1fr, 2fr and 3fr  
 
and this `grid-auto-rows: 3fr;` will still be in effect  
 
So if I were to add extras  rows down here and save you'll see that those will all be 3fr  
 
And if I wanted three columns I could do that as well `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);`  
 
So you can really create the layout that you want  
 
and you can span items across multiple rows and columns and I'm going to show you how to do that as well
