# 14. Block and Inline Level Elements

---

_Every HTML element has a default display value_

depending on what type of element it is.

> There are two display values: ...

`block and inline.`

`Block-level Elements` (3 points)...

A block-level element always starts on a new line.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.

_Here are the block-level elements in HTML:_

```html
<address>  <article>  <aside>  <blockquote>  <canvas>

<dd>  <div>  <dl>  <dt>  <fieldset>  <figcaption>

<figure>  <footer>  <form>  <h1>-<h6>  <header>  <hr>

<li>  <main>  <nav>  <noscript> <ol>  <p>  <pre>

<section>  <table>  <tfoot>  <ul>  <video>
```

`Inline Elements` (3 points)...

An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!

_Here are the inline elements in HTML:_

```html
<a>  <abbr>  <acronym>  <b>  <bdo>  <big>  <br>

<button>  <cite>  <code>  <dfn>  <em>  <i>  <img>

<input>  <kbd>  <label>  <map>  <object>  <output>

<q>  <samp>  <script>  <select>  <small>  <span>

<strong>  <sub>  <sup>  <textarea>  <time>  <tt>  <var>
```

_(14.7) inline block_

and you also have something called inline block which I'll talk about when we get to CSS because it doesn't really pertain to to just html
