# JSX

- JSX looks like html but it's really JavaScript because `JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript`.

- > Features

  > `Not indent-meaning`

  We can indent however we want without any consequence. We can use 2 spaces, 4 spaces or even tabs.

  It’s the opportunity to keep the code clean and understandable.

  > `Must contain one element`

The render can only contain one element. In our case, it’s an `<h1>`, but it can be something else:

```jSX
root.render(
  <div>Hello React</div>
  )
```

This element can have as many children as we want:

```jSX
  root.render(
    <div>
      <h1>Hello React</h1>
      <p>Some content</p>
    </div>
  )
```

Those children can have even more children:

```JSX
root.render(
    <div>
        <h1>Hello React</h1>
        <p><strong>Some</strong> <em>content</em></p>
    </div >
)
```

> `fragments`

But if we really want to have multiple elements without having one main parent, we can use what we call a fragment (<>…</>):

```jsx
root.render(
  <>
    <h1>Hello React</h1>
    <p>Some content</p>
  </>,
)
```

A fragment is just a container that `won’t be rendered as a DOM Element`.

> `No auto closing`

We can’t write `<br>` or `<img>` without closing them.

We have to add the closing tag or add the / at the end (before the >):

```jsx
root.render(
  <div>
    <h1>Hello React</h1>
    <p>
      Some
      <br />
      content
    </p>
  </div>,
)
```

> `Reserved keywords`

Some keywords like class or for are reserved.

class becomes `className`

for becomes `htmlFor`

```jsx
root.render(
  <div>
    <h1 className='title'>Hello React</h1>

    <p>
      Some
      <br />
      content
    </p>

    <label htmlFor='name'>Name</label>
    <input id='name' type='checkbox' />
  </div>,
)
```

There are many other reserved keywords, but class and for are the most commonly used ones.

> `Single quotes and double quotes`

Attributes can be written with single quotes or double:

```jsx
root.render(
  <div>
    <h1 className='title'>Hello React</h1>

    <p>
      Some
      <br />
      content
    </p>

    <label htmlFor='name'>Name</label>
    <input id='name' type='checkbox' />
  </div>,
)
```

It’s up to your preferences, but you should stick to your choice throughout the whole project. Consistency is key.

> `Injections (Javascript expressions in JSX)`

We can inject variables and execute JavaScript inside {...}:

```jsx
// ...

const toto = 'tata'

root.render(
  <div>
    <h1 className='title'>Hello {toto}</h1>
    <p>
      Some
      <br />
      content {Math.random()}
    </p>
  </div>,
)
```

- But we can’t write any JavaScript between { and }.

Here are a few examples of what we can do:

`{ 1 + 1 }`: Do math operations
`{ Date.now() }`: Call method from JavaScript objects that returns something
`{ myFunction() }`: Call custom method that returns something
`{ myFunction }`: Send a function (that function won’t be called, we are just sending it)
`{ () => {} }`: Send a function that we create on the fly
`{ myArray.map(…) }`: Call methods that go through an array and return things
`{ 'random number :' + Math.random() }`: Concatenate
`{ random number : ${Math.random()} }`: Concatenate using backticks
`{ <h1>A title<h1> }`: Return tags
And here are a few things we can’t do:

`{ if(...) }`
`{ for(...) }`
`{ while(...) }`

Those are just examples so that you get the idea. We are going to put that into practice anyway.

> `Comments`

Commenting is a bit tricky because we have to open and close the `{...}` and then create a JS block comment `/* ... */`:

```js
root.render(
  <div>
    {/* Some comment */}
    <h1 className='title'>Hello {toto}</h1>
    <p>
      Some
      <br />
      content {Math.random()}
    </p>
  </div>,
)
```
