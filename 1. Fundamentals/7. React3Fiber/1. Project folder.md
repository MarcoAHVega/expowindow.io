# 41. First React Application

> From scratch
> (Letâ€™s see how we can create a React app without using NPX now.)

1. Create the base project

- Create a folder and name it the way you want. `first-react-application`
- Go inside the folder using the terminal
- We are going to create a project with `npm init -y`

2. Versions

- starting from now, we are going to use very specific versions of the dependencies
- for future projects, you should update the dependencies to the latest versions and make sure that everything is working properly `npm install theDependency@latest`

3. Dependencies

- From your terminal in the project folder, run `npm install react@18 react-dom@18.2 react-scripts@5.0` to install dependencies.

3. Scripts

- Add the two following scripts in the "scripts" property in package.json (you can remove the "test" script):

```json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build"
  }
  // ...
}
```
