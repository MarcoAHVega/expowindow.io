# 102. Defining and Planning the Project (Steps 1 and 2)

0.  The Project:

    - > In this step I ether choose or I'm offer a project by a client, but for now `I am starting by doing website mockups`

1.  Content

    - Ideally we need to develop a discovery phase including all the questions design to gather all the information and content needed for the project,

    - but for now `I will gather all the information needed by deconstructing the actual website to be mock`

    - > then we put everything in a `md` file:
    - content
    - company info
    - components
    - sections
    - branding

    - > To start we are using Jonas' `omnifood content.md` example:

    - > use this example md as a template and get the actual content by mimicking a website re-design
