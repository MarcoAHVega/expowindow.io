7. MAINTAIN AND KEEP UPDATING WEBSITE (360)

   - > Launching is not the end...

   - > Keep the website content updated over time. If youâ€™re working with a client, you can create a monthly maintenance contract (recurring revenue)

   - > Install analytics software (e.g. Google Analytics or Fathom) to get statistics about website users. This may inform future changes in the site structure and content.

   - > A blog that is updated regularly is a good way to keep users coming back, and is also good for SEO.
