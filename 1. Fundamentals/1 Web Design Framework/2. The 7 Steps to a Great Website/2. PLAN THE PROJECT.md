2. PLAN THE PROJECT (355)

   - > Plan and gather website content:

     copy (text), images, videos etc.

   - > Content is usually provided by the client,

     but you also can help them produce and find some content (simply finding free images is easiest, but if they want copy, charge them extra)

   - > For bigger sites, plan out the sitemap:

     what pages the site needs, and how they are related to one another (content hierarchy)

   - > Based on the content, plan what sections each page needs

     in order to convey the contentâ€™s message, and in which order

   - > Define the website personality

     (See web design section)
