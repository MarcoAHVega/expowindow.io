2.  RESPONSIVE DESIGN INGREDIENTS (372)

    - > 1. FLUID LAYOUTS

      - To allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width (or even height)

      - Use % (or vh / vw) unit instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport (usually layout)

      - Use max-width instead of width

    - > 2. RESPONSIVE UNITS

      - Use rem unit instead of px for most lengths

      - To make it easy to scale the entire layout down (or up) automatically

      - Helpful trick: setting 1rem to 10px for easy calculations

    - > 3. FLEXIBLE IMAGES

      - By default, images donâ€™t scale automatically as we change the viewport, so we need to fix that

      - Always use % for image dimensions, together with the max-width property

    - > 4. MEDIA QUERIES

      - Bring responsive sites to life!

      - To change CSS styles on certain viewport widths (called breakpoints)
