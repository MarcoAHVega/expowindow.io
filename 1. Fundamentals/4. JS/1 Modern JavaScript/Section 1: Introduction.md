## 1. Why You Should Take This Course

- > JavaScript is a universal programming language.

  It can be used to do many, many different things from creating websites and mobile apps to running server side programs or even programming robots.

- > In this course, we're going to be focusing on the front end usage of JavaScript in a browser

  which is what it was originally designed for,

## 2. Why JavaScript is Amazing

- > It can be used in so many different ways 

  that it's actually mind blowing and it's usage really has kind

  of exploded over the last few years to the point where now you can use it to program a mobile application

  or a robot or even to create a virtual reality experience.

## 3. Setting up Your Environment

- > I'll be using my favorite edit at the minute, which is `VS code`

- > I want to show you a couple of different `extensions`

  The first one, which is the most important one, is this `live server` package.

  - a local development server, and that allows our computer

  to act as a server for our websites so we can type in a specific local address into a browser hit enter.

  And that's going to tell our computer to serve up our website files, our HTML success and JavaScript to the browser so that we can view them.

  `material icon theme`

  `Monokai++` this is just a theme for vs code

- > create a `project folder`

## 4. Course Files

- > I've created `course files` for every single lesson 
 
  - with code in it from Chapter two onwards in this course, and you can find all of those files on this GitHub repo right here. https://github.com/iamshaunjp/modern-javascript

  - this course is going to also contain several real world projects.

  And in those chapters, what I'm going to do is also `attach the end code` for the project to the last lecture of those chapters.
