& 35. Project Intro
? (35.1) start our first project
? (35.2) background images
? (35.3) So let's take a look at the project
-----------------------------------------------------------------
?(35.1) start our first project
   All right guys so we're going to start our first project and it's gonna be a small hotel Web site called Hotel Beatie or HB T. 
   
   And we're gonna be using everything that we've learned up to this point. 
   
   So everything from the HD him on the CSF sandbox 
   
   I'm not going to throw in any extra technologies like the grid system or or media queries to make it responsive. 
   
   I only want to deal with stuff we've already learned. Once we learn that other stuff then we'll build projects using that other stuff. Okay. 
   
   So if any of you guys are more experienced and you're saying a widely used CSX grid for this because we haven't learned that yet. OK. 
   
? (35.2) background images
   Now notice there are some background images in this project. There will be in this lecture in the downloads a zip file called Image Resources and it's going to have all the images that are included in this project 
   
   and where I usually get my images as pixels dot com p x e l s dot com and there's tons of free really really high quality stock images. 
   
   So what I did as I just search for hotel and they found my images here. And if you click on one you can download different sizes so it's it's a great resource. It's completely free and the photos are just as high quality is as premium photos are. 
   
? (35.3) So let's take a look at the project
   So up top we have navigation bar. 
   
   We have a logo we're just using an H1 here but you could easily use an image if you wanted. 
   
   We have a home about contact with a background hover effect and whatever the current pages is also going to have the background 
   
   then we have a showcase area with a background image. 
   
   Now this background image I did open up in photoshop and I faded it a little bit just so that the text was more readable. Now you can do this with just CSX but we haven't gone over that yet. So that's something we'll do in another project. 
   
   But for now we're just going to use the faded out image. OK. 
   
   So have some text on this. We have a link formatted as a button then down here we have some floated boxes. We have an image of some text here. 
   
   And then here we have three boxes with some icons. Now we haven't gone over icons yet and the way that we're using these is with a third party service called font awesome which is really awesome. And it's very popular it's used all the time and basically all we have to do is include their style sheet their CSX and we can just add classes to elements and we can get these cool looking icons and we can actually resize them with certain classes and so on. All right. 
   
   So we'll do that and then we have a simple footer with a copyright. 
   
   And then on the about page we have some texts. We have an image rounded with border radius and then we have a background image with some testimonials where we float the images in the text and then 
   
   on the contact page we have a form that we're going to style and then some icons down here with location phone number and address. 
   
   Now as I've said before you can't have a contact form work with just aged team email you need to have some kind of server side language like peach P or something like that which is beyond the scope of this course. 
   
   Now at the end of this course I may include a video or a reference to a video where you can you know I'll show you how to use a peach piece script or something like that to submit a contact form but just not just know that the submission of a form is out of the scope of this course. OK. So those are the three pages that we'll be creating. 
   
   Now it's this site is not completely responsive. You'll see if I go down really small I mean it looks OK as far as the menu in this here. This even looks OK. This should actually be stacked and not in three rows. I think they're too narrow but we're not going to do that just yet. We may do it later on we get into media queries and stuff like this doesn't really look very good contact page contact page looks OK again these should be stacked but we'll get into that later on. I don't want to start to do things that we haven't talked about yet. OK. So that's it. Guys let's get started with the project.
