*All right guys now I'm going to show you how to take a grid item and span it across multiple rows and columns.*...

Now what I want to do is take one of these items we'll take the first one and I want to show you how we can span it across okay across the columns and also down through the rows.  
 
I want to show you kind of a long way first and then I'll show you a short away.

*So let's first target this first item.*...

We could give it a special class but well let's just use our pseudo selectors.

We'll use first child  
 
*So I'll say*...

```
.item:first-child {

}  
```  
 
*and we have a property called*... 

```
.item:first-child {
   grid-column-start:
}  
```  
 
OK so *we can specify where we want it to start In terms of the columns*. 

So it starts at 1 right now (by default)

Let's say let's just put it to 2 and save...

```
.item:first-child {
   grid-column-start: 2;
}  
```  
 
And you can see that it gets pushed over. OK.  
 
So we can start at wherever we want

*but I'm going to started at 1*...

```
.item:first-child {
   grid-column-start: 1;
}  
``` 

and then *I'm going to use another property called*...

```
.item:first-child {
   grid-column-start: 1;
   grid-column-end:
}  
```  
 
And we can basically tell it where we want it to end 

and I'm going to put in here 4...

```
.item:first-child {
   grid-column-start: 1;
   grid-column-end: 4;
}  
```  

And you can see what happens is it spanned across what looks like 3.  
 
But what you're going to do is you're going to look at the lines one, two, three, four. OK.  
 
So if you use this grid column and start now and that's what you're going to look at is you're going to count these lines.  

*Now we can also go down*... 

and that's that's the big difference between the grid and flex box, or one of them 

is that you can't do that with Flexbox 

you have your rows and that's it  

with the grid we can we can be multi-dimensional 

and we can span this down into the next one. 

*So let's add*...

```
.item:first-child {
   grid-column-start: 1;
   grid-column-end: 4;
   grid-row-start: 1;
}  
```  
 
and we'll start at 1 which is where we currently are.

*And then let's say*...

```
.item:first-child {
   grid-column-start: 1;
   grid-column-end: 4;
   grid-row-start: 1;
   grid-row-end: 3;
}  
```  
 
and let's say we want to end at 3  
 
and I'm going to save that.  
 
And now you can see that this is now spanning basically Well look what looks like two rows.  
 
But again if you look at the lines it's going from one to three.

*Now this is kind of a long way to do this, There's a shorter way much like with many things and CSS*...

So I'm going to *comment this out*...

```
.item:first-child {
   /* grid-column-start: 1;
   grid-column-end: 4;
   grid-row-start: 1;
   grid-row-end: 3; */

   }
```
and I'm going to show you how to do the same thing by using the grid-column and the grid row property rather than start and end 

*And so let's say*...

```
.item:first-child {
   /* grid-column-start: 1;
   grid-column-end: 4;
   grid-row-start: 1;
   grid-row-end: 3; */
   grid-colum:
   }  
```  
 
So it's basically just a shortcut 

and we're gonna say start at 1 

and then we want to do a slash  (/) 

and we want to span 3...

```
.item:first-child {
   /* grid-column-start: 1;
   grid-column-end: 4;
   grid-row-start: 1;
   grid-row-end: 3; */
   grid-colum: 1 / span 3;
   }  
```  
 
So I save that you can see it's doing the same thing that these two lines are doing.  
 
And even though I put 4 here  
 
when I put 3 it does the same thing  
 
because here we're saying we want to take we want an item to start at 1 and go to 4 when here we're saying we're taking item 1 and spanning it 3.

*Now if we want to go down like we did before*...

Down down a row we can do...

```
.item:first-child {
   /* grid-column-start: 1;
   grid-column-end: 4;
   grid-row-start: 1;
   grid-row-end: 3; */
   grid-colum: 1 / span 3;
   grid-row: 1 / span 2;
   }  
```  

grid-row  
 
and let's start at one.  
 
And we want to span two  
 
and we'll save.  
 
And we get the same result. OK.  
 
So this is just a shorter way of doing this.  

*Let's grab another one*...  
 
So let's let's get a random one we'll just take 9.  
 
So we'll use nth-child...

```
.item:nth-child(9) {

}  
```  
so we'll say item and let's say and the child and we'll do nine

*and I want to keep it in its place but span it across all the way to the end here*....

So in terms of columns it's in the second column. Right. 

So we want to do grid dash column and we want to set 2. 

We want to start at 2 and then we want to span 3. OK. 

And then if we want to span it down we could do grid row 

and let's start it. So we're at 1 2 3 4. So let's say start at 4 

and let's span 2 and save. 

And now it gets pushed down. OK. 

```
.item:nth-child(9) {
   grid-colum: 2 / span 3;
   grid-row: 4 / span 2;
}  
```  
 
So I mean you can start it wherever you want like we could do grid row 2 and span 2 and it's going to get it's going to get pushed up here. All right.  
 
And notice that it's completely out of order but you may want that you may you may want your markup to be a certain way but you want to move the the element visually without changing your markup. So the grid is good for that as well. All right. So in the next video we're going to take a look at auto fitting and min max.
