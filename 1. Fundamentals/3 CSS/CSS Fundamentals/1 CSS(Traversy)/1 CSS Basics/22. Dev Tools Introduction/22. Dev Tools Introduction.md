_(22.1) open the dev tools (F12)_...

_(22.2) the Elements tab_...

we want to focus on is the elements tab

it shows us all the html assets for the page.

_(22.3) hover over elements_...

Now notice when I hover over something like the body it actually highlights everything that's in the body

_(22.4) the select tool_...

and then if we want to select something we can go ahead and hit the select tool.

I can click an element and notice that it's now highlighted down here

and it also shows me the CSS.

_(22.5) default browser styling (user agent style sheet)_...

Every browser has default styling for the most part it's pretty much the same.

_(22.6) change stuff here to, temporarily_...

Now we can actually change stuff here too temporarily.

And if we reload the page it goes back to normal.
