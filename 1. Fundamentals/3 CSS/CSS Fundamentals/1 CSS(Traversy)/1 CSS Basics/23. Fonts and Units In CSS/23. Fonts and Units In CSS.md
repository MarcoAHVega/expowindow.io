_(23.1) adding a font family_...

- let's add a selector for the body.
- That's usually where you're going to add your font family because then it affects your whole page.

So we want to use...

```
body {
font-family:
}
```

which takes in a font stack...

So basically a list of different fonts  
in vscode we get this cool dropdown speaking of font stacks that we can choose from

_(23.2) web safe fonts_...

you have the ability to use pretty much any font that you want. You can get your hands on.

But these right here you don't need to do anything extra for because they're going to be available in all all browsers that users are using to view your Web site with.

_(23.3) font stacks_...

And notice that there is some of these there's multiple fonts.

These are actually called font stacks.

For instance this first one aerial Helvetica sans serif.

What's going to happen is it's going to look for the aerial font to use it.

If it can't find that it will move to use Helvetica.

If it can't find that a little use to use any sans serif font.

_(23.4) adding a font stack_...

```
body {
font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

_(23.5) using Google fonts_  
we can add google fonts using a link tag...

```
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto" rel="stylesheet">

--------------------------------------------

body {
   font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
```

_(23.6) font-size_...

- Now the standard is 16 pixels, and that's actually on the html tag.

The html tag by default has a font size of 16 pixels

So let's change it to 18 pixels...

```
body {
font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
font-size: 18px;
}
```

And for the most part I usually leave it at 16. But just to show you I'll change it to 18 save and I can see it's bigger.

_(23.7) line-height_...

Also we can adjust the line-height which is basically the height of each line.

And this is going to this is usually in em units

- a common value I like to use for the line height for the body is 1.6em...

```
body {
font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
font-size: 18px;
line-height: 1.6em;
}
```

_(23.8) CSS Absolute Units_...

pixels is the common absolute unit that you're going to use you can use
_centimeters cm_,  
_millimeters mm_,  
_inches in_,

_pixels px_,

- and the exact size of size of one pixel is (1/96th of 1 in)

_points pt_,  
_picas pc_.

_(23.9) CSS Relative Units_...

Now there's also something called relative units:

_percentage %_

- You can set it to percentage of a parent element.

this doesn't have to be just font size, This could be for margin, padding, line height, width height.

_em_

- is basically it's a multiplier of the size of your parent element

_rem_

- rem units act the same way except instead of the parent element they use the root html element which by default is 16 pixels.

_(23.10) how to target these span_...  
 create a div with an id of welcome, inside we need a paragraph with a span

```
#welcome p span {
}
```

_(23.11) font-weight_

and let's say we want to make the font weight bold and notice that this...

```
#welcome p span {
font-weight: bold;
}
```

And notice how now the span the text it's within the span is bold.  
so just like the strong tag we can set it to bold through CSX.

_(23.12) font-style_

So let's target this This span down here by saying we want the about div paragraph span and we're going to set the font style to italic and save...

```
#about p span {
font-style: italic;
}
```

And now you can see it is very faint but this text is now italic.
