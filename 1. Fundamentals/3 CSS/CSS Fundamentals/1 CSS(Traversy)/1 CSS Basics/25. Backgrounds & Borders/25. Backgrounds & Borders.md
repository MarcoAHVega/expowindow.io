*(25.1) if you want transparency then use...

*png image.*

(box-1) if you want to style the background color you use...

*(25.2) background-color property*  
 
And I'm just gonna choose this Blanchedalmond...

```
#box-1 {
background-color:blanchedalmond;
}  
```  
 
Notice that this whole div now has that background color.


*(25.3) border has three mandatory properties*...

border-width:  
border-color:  
border-style:  

*(25.4) border-width*...

So the first one is gonna be width and this can be in any order but we're going to do with first.  
 
So let's say 3 pixels...

```
#box-1 {
background-color:blanchedalmond;
border-width: 3px;
}
```
 
* Now if I just just do that and take a look. We have nothing there's no change because we need all three properties

*(25.5) border-color*...

the next one is gonna be the color.  
 
So we want to say border dash color and let's just do red...  

```
#box-1 {
background-color:blanchedalmond;
border-width: 3px;
border-color: red;
}
```

*(25.6) border-style*  
 
And then the last one is gonna be border style which can be...
 
dashed, dotted, double, groove.  
 
The most popular is gonna be solid...

```
#box-1 {
background-color:blanchedalmond;
border-width: 3px;
border-color: red;
border-style: solid;
}  
``` 
 
And now we have a three pixel wide red solid border.  
  
And just to give you an idea of some of the other styles we can do like  
*dotted*  
 
for Take a look at that. That's the dotted border. And what else we have  
*dashed*


*(25.7) single border property*...

we can do is just use the single border property and we can actually add all three of those in here...

```
#box-1 {
background-color:blanchedalmond;
/* border-width: 3px;
border-color: red;
border-style: solid; */
border: 3px solid red;
}  
```  
 
* and it doesn't matter the order either you can use any order.

(box-2) Now we can also use just...

*(25.8) background* (if we want to add a color or background image)  
 
give box-2 a dark gray background...

```
#box-2 {
background: #333;
}
```
and let's give it a color text color of white... 

```
#box-2 {
background: #333;
color: #fff;
}
```
let's say we just want a border (blue solid three pixels) on the top...

*(25.9) border-top (bottom  left  right)*...

```
#box-2 {
background: #333;
color: #fff;
border-top: blue solid 3px;
}
```

(box-1) by default our corners are just straight corners.  
 
But we can rounded off if we want using...

*(25.10) border radius*

```
#box-1 {
background-color:blanchedalmond;
/* border-width: 3px;
border-color: red;
border-style: solid; */
border: 3px solid red;
border-radius: 10px;
}  
```   
 
And if we take a look now we have rounded corners.

(box-2) now if we wanted to just add rounded corners (let's say 10 pixels) to the top...

*(25.11) border-top-left-radius* and...

*(25.12) border-top-right-radius*...

```
#box-2 {
background: #333;
color: #fff;
border-top: blue solid 3px;
border-top-left-radius: 10px;
border-top-right-radius: 10px;
}  
```  
 
* Now you don't even have to have a border property to use border radius like we could still round the bottom edges even though there's no border.


(box-3) A lot of times you might want to have some kind of image is your background. 

So let's use box 3 and let's use the...
 
*(25.13) background-image property*

So this is going to actually take in a...

*url()*  
 
and in here we could use a remote image, But what we want to do is  
 
*(25.14) target the  JPEG file that's in our image folder*...

```
#box-3 {
background-image: url('./img/stars.jpg');
}
```

let's go back and notice that it uses the background image.  
 
* Now you're not going to see you don't see the whole image because it only takes up the space of the actual element.

*(25.15) set a height and width and change the text color*...

```
#box-3 {
background-image: url('./img/stars.jpg');
color: #fff;
height: 300px;
width: 600px;
}
```
with background you have a bunch of other properties just like with border one of those is...

*(25.16) background-repeat:*  
 
So let's go ahead and set the property  
 
and there's a few options here...

*background-repeat: repeat;*  
 
* you can do repeat which is the default. 
It repeats both ways.

*background-repeat: repeat-x;*  
 
* will only repeat on the x axis which is horizontal

*background-repeat: repeat-y;*  

* will go on the up and down the y axis.


But what we want is...

*background-repeat: no-repeat;*  
 
* because we don't want to repeat...

```
#box-3 {
background-image: url('./img/stars.jpg');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
color: #fff;
height: 300px;
width: 600px;
}
```

*(25.17) background-position*...
 
* this will move the image around.  
* It takes in 2 values.  
* The first is going to be the x axis and the second is the y axis.
 
*pixels values*...

```
#box-3 {
background-image: url('./img/stars.jpg');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: 100px 100px;
color: #fff;
height: 300px;
width: 600px;
}
```

*we can do negative values*...

```
#box-3 {
background-image: url('./img/stars.jpg');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: -100px -100px;
color: #fff;
height: 300px;
width: 600px;
}
```

*you also have keywords*...

* you can use like top, center, and bottom,... 

```
#box-3 {
background-image: url('./img/stars.jpg');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: center center;
color: #fff;
height: 300px;
width: 600px;
}
```

And you can see what it did is it just centered it.  
 
If I wanted to take the y axis and move it up to the top we could do that as well...

```
#box-3 {
background-image: url('./img/stars.jpg');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: center top;
color: #fff;
height: 300px;
width: 600px;
}
```

*(25.18) background-size: cover;*...

Now in most cases you're going to want the whole image to cover the background...

```
#box-3 {
background-image: url('./img/stars.jpg');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: center top;
background-size: cover;
color: #fff;
height: 300px;
width: 600px;
}
```

*(25.19) we can use background for all together*...

```
#box-3 {
/* background-image: url('./img/stars.jpg');
background-repeat: no-repeat;
background-position: center top;
background-size: cover; */
background: url('./img/stars.jpg') no-repeat center center/cover;
color: #fff;
height: 300px;
width: 600px;
}
```

(box-4) *(25.20) background-attachment: fixed;*...

I want to show you how we can make a make this a fixed image and to give you an example let me just make this smaller so we have a more of a scroll.  
 
Now if I scroll see all the image just kind of stays in place. We can make it fixed. So let's go back up to box for and let's actually position it differently too so let's let's do center bottom. See what that looks like so now it's out Senator bottom do center center.  

```
#box-4 {
background: url('./img/leaf.png') no-repeat center center;
background-attachment: fixed;
}
```
 
* And now watch when I scroll the image just stays in place and it's fixed to the to the browser window.
