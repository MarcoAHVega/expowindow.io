_(30.1) change a block element to be inline (a way to create a horizontal menu)_

- by default list items are block level. Right.

If we open up our our tools and we we use our element selector we look at the list item you can see that it goes all the way across and it knocks the next one down. So that that's a block level element.

- Now we can change that to be inline and in fact this could be a way to create a horizontal menu horizontal navigation.

_grave the li and let's set it to_...

- display: inline;...

```
li {
display: inline;
}
```

- So notice that now it's going this way And the bullets are no longer showing either.

- Now you probably want to spread these out a little bit...

so we could do put these on the on the links so li a and...

- let's set padding

right to 20 pixels...

```
li {
display: inline;
}

li a {
padding-right: 20px;
}
```

- So that's how we can change block level elements to inline.

_(30.2) take an inline elements such as an image and make it block level_...

Now let's take an inline elements such as an image

and make it block level

I'm going to show you a reason why you would do this...

So let's put a couple of line breaks in

and we'll put in an image

and inside of our folder we still have the AMG folder with the leaf dot PMG.

I'm going to use that...

```
<img src="./img/leaf.png" alt="My image">
```

OK. Now this is an inline element.

If we grab the selector

and we take a look you see how it doesn't go all the way across.

If I were to put another image in.

Actually if I just duplicate this and save it's going to go next to

it it doesn't get pushed on to the next line.

Now I want to make this a block level element

we get rid of one of these.

And the reason I want to do that is because I want to add margin: auto

because I want it in the middle.

```
img {
margin: auto;
}
```

If I were to do that now if I were to do that now nothing happens because we can't do this.

- We can't do margin auto on an inline element.

It needs it needs to be block level so we'll simply say...

display block and save...

```
img {
display: block;
margin: auto;
}
```

\*And now we can actually add margin-auto.

I can't tell you how how confusing that was to me a long time ago when I was just trying to simply center an image and margin auto just wouldn't work.

I didn't realize that the the element had to be be display block to be able to do that.

_These are two situations where you would want to display something that's normally block is in line and normally in line is block._

_(30.3) to align these 3 boxes (divs) going across (to display horizontally)_...

Now let's say we want some divs here some some box divs like we've been dealing with

just going to put a couple of line breaks

and let's do a class of box and an H three

just say heading and then let's put paragraph Lorem 20

- and let's say we have three of these...

Go ahead and save

_First let's style them a little bit_

just so we can kind of see the outline and stuff like that.

So we'll do what we've been doing. Just give him a quick background.

Border actually let's not even Sullivan do a border let's just do padding 20 pixels.

What else do margin bottom 15 pixel.

```
.box {
background: #f4f4f4;
padding: 20px;
margin-bottom: 15px;
}
```

- And we want these to display horizontally...
- So obviously we need a width...

So width let's do thirty two percent now if I save that we get that width...

```
.box {
width: 32%;
display: inline;
background: #f4f4f4;
padding: 20px;
margin-bottom: 15px;
}
```

- But they're still on top of each other because by default divs are displayed as block.
  So maybe we just need to do inline. Right.

Let's do display in line and save.

And that doesn't work and be the reason this isn't working.

And it'll show you right in here and V.S. code that this property width is being ignored because

display you can't use with on inline, And the margin is also being ignored.

_So the solution to this if we want these to go across is to use inline block which is basically like a mix of both._

It goes horizontal but it also allows us to add widths.

So let's change it to inline Dash. BLOCK And save...

```
.box {
width: 32%;
display: inline-block;
background: #f4f4f4;
padding: 20px;
margin-bottom: 15px;
}
```

_add the box sizing properties_...

Now this is getting knocked on to the next line because again we have padding.

So that's getting added to the width

because we didn't add the box sizing properties

so let's go up here and we can just put it in here. So box sizing order box and save...

```
.box {
width: 32.8%;
display: inline-block;
box-sizing: border-box;
background: #f4f4f4;
padding: 20px;
margin-bottom: 15px;
}
```

- And now you'll see that there are lying side by side.

You can probably even do 33.

No let's do like thirty two point.

I don't think I mentioned that

- we can do decimals and percentages like that. OK.  
  So that looks pretty cool actually.

But yeah that's so we have display inline display block and display inline block and then

- later on we get to flex we can do display flex.

- We can also do display grid. And I'm going to I'm going to talk all about that and the different properties that are associated with that as well

but yeah. So that's that's that in the next video we're going to look at positioning there's different types of positioning relative absolute fixed. So I want to explain what the differences between all of those in the next video
