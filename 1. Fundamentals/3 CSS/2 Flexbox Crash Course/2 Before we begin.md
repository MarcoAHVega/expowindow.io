# before we begin

before we begin let me go over a few
points

- first i would like to mention this course is for complete beginners

if you're someone who is new to flexbox or have an idea about flexbox and want
to understand better please continue

if you are an expert
this is your cue to probably hop into another video where your time can be better utilized

- second this video is a continuation of the css
  crash course

make sure you are familiar with both html and css before proceeding

in this video we are going to learn the important concepts in flexbox

if you are also interested in css grid we will be learning that in a separate
video

but if you have the question should you be learning flexbox or grid
my advice would be to learn both

flexbox is great for one directional
flow and can actually work alongside grid for more complex layouts

it's not rare to see code bases which use both

now please do make sure you could along
with me as that is the best way to learn

by the end of this video you will have a
solid understanding of creating layouts with css flexbox
