& 10 We can include an option named "no fast forward" to merge branches      
* I want to show you `an option you can use to merge branches in a slightly different way.` 
      
   - We can include an option named `git merge our-features --no-ff` 
      
   - this stands for `no fast forward` 

   - certain teams and certain employers will want you to merge using this option.

   ^ 
   git merge our-features --no-ff
      
   - So when you use the no fast forward option Git gives you a chance `to include a merge commit message`.
      ^
      Merge branch 'our-features'

      # Please enter a commit message to explain why  this merge is necessary,
      # especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch.
      #
      # Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts
      # the commit. 
      
   - Now nine times out of 10 I would say that this default message of merge branch 'our-features', is A-OK. 
      
   - So to use that you can just hit the` escape key` on your keyboard and then type in `:wq` and press enter 
      
   - that little bit of keyboard wizardry that we just performed is beyond the scope of this course. We were basically editing a text message `using vim` but that's not important for right now. 
      
   - So now that we completed that merge Let's go ahead and `push our master branch up to github.` 
      
   - So I can show you a visual example of what the `--no-ff` option `really does`. 
      
   - So to push master up to github lets just type 
      ^
      git push origin master 
      
   - And now if we check out `github.com` and go to the main page for `your travel site repo` 
      
   - If you click on commits. Here's the commit When we completed the our feature section. and because we used the no fast forward option `we see a dedicated commit just for the merge.` 
      
   - So if you remember we made each of these three commits to the count to 10 branch and when we merge that branch back into Master 
      
   - `because we didn't include the no fast forward option` git simply fast forward the master's branch history `to point towards the last commit from the count to 10 branch.` 
      
   - Now there is no right or wrong way to merge a branch. I just want you to be aware of the differences because `certain teams that you are on will have certain preferences.` 
      
   - So if we scroll back up to the top and click on this dedicated commit for the merge this will show us the diff. Basically what changed in which files when we performed the merge. 
      
   - Now in this case we only merged in this one commit. 
      
   - But if this was a larger feature and maybe it took us a week to complete it and maybe our progress was broken up into 10 commits 
      
   - most people on our team are not going to want to have to dig through 10 separate commits to see what changed. 
      
   - In a case like that `it is much much easier to just look at the Consolidated merge comment` which will show all of the changes from all 10 of those hypothetical comments in one convenient location. 

   - So hopefully that gives you an idea of what the no fast forward option does. 
      
   - `It creates a dedicated commit in your repos history which is a consolidated place to see all of the changes in all of the commits for that branch` 

   - at the end of the day you can merge branches using that option or not. 

   - The important thing is that I want to at least be on your radar.
