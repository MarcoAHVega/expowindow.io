(29.3)
& 2 how to create a new branch
todo> we want to `create a new branch for each new feature or experiment that we want to work on`

(29.4)
~ step 1
todo>  Now before we create a new branch `we want to make sure that we currently have a clean working directory`. 
   
   * That `just means we don't want to have any uncommitted changes`. 
   
   todo> So if we go ahead and run 
   ^
   git status 
   
   * you can see that I personally have several files that haven't been committed yet.

~ step 2
todo> Let's go ahead and add any uncommitted files to our staging area 
   
   todo> if we want we can add them one by one. 
   
      * So for example if I wanted to add this file to my staging area I can just type git add and then the path to that file.
      ^
      git add app/index.html

      * you can just type git add -A uppercase a and that will add everything to the staging area in one step
      ^
      git add -A

      todo> let's say that `you want to remove a file from the staging area`. 
   
      * So just as an example if I wanted `to un-stage the index.html` file I can just type
      ^
      git reset app/index.html 

(29.5)
~ step 3 last
todo> create a new branch is as simple as typing `git branch` and then `the name of the new branch that you want to create`.

   *So let's name our new branch
   ^ 
   git branch count-to-ten

   todo> So now if we run 
   ^
   git branch
   
   * to see a list of all of the branches in our repo we see `
   
   - count-to-ten 
   -* master

   * the star next to master indicates that it's the branch we are currently working with.`
