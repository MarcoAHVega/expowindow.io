# 230. Accessing Object Properties

```
So now that we created this object and we understand how we can add line breaks, how can we work with this object?

Before in an array, we could either use the entire array or point at individual items by using their index.
```

- => For objects, it's not that different than arrays.

1. If we want to output the job title, let's say, then we again use the variable name, job, but now we can add a dot here.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
  title: 'developer',
  place: 'New York',
  salary: 50000,
}

alert(hobbies[0])
alert(job.)
```

> If we add a dot here, we should get auto completion. If you don't get it, you can manually trigger it with control space. You need to type that dot first, though.

- => This dot is a special syntax, which we can use in JavaScript, to access the different properties of our object.

> And here we can see that the IDE, Visual Studio Code, automatically suggests these three properties.

```
It also suggests a couple of other things, but these are just some guesses it makes, which are not directly related to this object and which actually won't work.
```

> We can see that these three suggestions are the actual properties of this object by this blue box here in front of them. That's how we can identify those suggestions.

2. And now if you want to output the title here, we can simply select it here in the dropdown and hit tab and simply alert job dot title.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
  title: 'developer',
  place: 'New York',
  salary: 50000,
}

alert(hobbies[0])
alert(job.title)
```

> And with this, if we saved this, if I reload, I first of all get sports and then thereafter, developer.

> So that works and that's how we can work with objects and their properties in our code.

> And objects are another important value type, which we'll work with quite a bit when writing JavaScript code.
