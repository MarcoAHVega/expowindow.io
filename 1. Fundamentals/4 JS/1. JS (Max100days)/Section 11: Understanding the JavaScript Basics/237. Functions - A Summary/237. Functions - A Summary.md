# 237. Functions - A Summary

```
Over the last lectures, I spent a lot of time on functions because functions are a super crucial and key feature which you will need all the time in JavaScript development

and that's why you need to understand them. And I hope I could explain those key basics.
```

- => We are going to write and use a lot of functions throughout this course so you will get a lot of practice, but the general idea should be clear by now.

- => I wanna emphasize again that functions don't need to return and don't need to take parameters.

> It will depend on which kind of function you're writing and what it's doing.

- => I also wanna emphasize again that functions of course can execute multiple steps in there

- => and you can of course also introduce variables in there, like result, which then are only available in this function.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
  title: 'developer',
  place: 'New York',
  salary: 50000,
}

let totalAdultYears

function calculateAdultYears(userAge) {
  let result

  return userAge - 18
}

totalAdultYears = calculateAdultYears(age)
alert(totalAdultYears)

age = 45
totalAdultYears = calculateAdultYears(age)

alert(totalAdultYears)
```

1. And then here we could store userAge minus 18 and result

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
  title: 'developer',
  place: 'New York',
  salary: 50000,
}

let totalAdultYears

function calculateAdultYears(userAge) {
  let result
  result = userAge - 18
  return userAge - 18
}

totalAdultYears = calculateAdultYears(age)
alert(totalAdultYears)

age = 45
totalAdultYears = calculateAdultYears(age)

alert(totalAdultYears)
```

2. and return the value stored and the result here.

```js
let age = 32
let userName = 'Max'
let hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking', 'Reading']
let job = {
  title: 'developer',
  place: 'New York',
  salary: 50000,
}

let totalAdultYears

function calculateAdultYears(userAge) {
  let result
  result = userAge - 18
  return result
}

totalAdultYears = calculateAdultYears(age)
alert(totalAdultYears)

age = 45
totalAdultYears = calculateAdultYears(age)

alert(totalAdultYears)
```

3. That would be an alternative way of writing this function, arguably an unnecessarily complex way, but to understand that you can do all these things and functions, I want to switch to that code for now.

- => So which code goes into a function And whether you return and/or whether you use parameters depends on what your function does.

> As I said, we're going to write many functions throughout this course, and therefore there will be plenty of opportunities to practice this.

> This is the general feature of functions. That's how it generally works. And now let's build up on that.
