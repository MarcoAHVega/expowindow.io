# 217. Module Introduction

```
Now after diving into tons of sections and content on HTML and CSS, finally, we are going to dive into that third very important programming language which I mentioned earlier at the very beginning of this course, do you recall which language that was? It was JavaScript.

And we're now going to dive into the basics of this very important programming language, which is a bit more advanced, which is why we are diving into it right now and not a right at the start of this course.

```

- => you're going to learn `what exactly JavaScript is` and `why you might wanna use it` or `why you might need it` on certain websites or for certain projects.

- => We are going to `explore its core syntax`, `its core feature se`t and `how we write JavaScript code`.

- => And of course, as we do it in the entire course, `there will be plenty of examples and demos`. And we are going to learn `all about JavaScript step-by-step` with practical examples.
