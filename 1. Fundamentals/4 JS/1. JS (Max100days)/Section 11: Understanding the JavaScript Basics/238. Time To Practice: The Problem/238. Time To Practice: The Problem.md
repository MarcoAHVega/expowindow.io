# 238. Time To Practice: The Problem

- => It's now time to practice what you learned and for that, attached you'll find this 'exercise.JS' file,

```
which is a brand new JavaScript file, which you can add to your project folder by dragging and dropping it in there.
```

- => And in that file, I've got some instructions for you.

- => As a side note, these are all JavaScript comments, you add them by adding two forward slashes,

```js
// This is how a comment is added to JavaScript
// Comments are not executed - they are just there to provide extra
// information to you or other developers
```

> and anything you write thereafter will not be interpreted as a command, but instead as just an annotation for you or other developers.

> But now let's move on to your concrete tasks. As you can see, I've got a couple of tasks here,

- => and the first task is that you create three new variables;

```js
// Exercise Time!

// 1) Create three new variables:
//    - A variable that stores the name of an online course of your choice
//    - A variable that stores the price of that course
//    - A variable that stores the three main goals that you have, when taking this course

let courseName = '100 Days Of Code - Web Development Bootcamp [2022]'
let coursePrice = 12.99
let courseGoals = ['learn HTML', 'learn CSS', 'learn JavaScript']
```

1. one variable that stores the name of an online course of your choice

2. another variable that stores the price of that course,

3. and a third variable that actually stores the three main goals that you might have when taking that course.

> So create these three variables and assign any values of your choice.

> Of course, think about the value types which you plan on using.

- => Now, once you completed the first task, take these variables and output alert them as we also did it before in this section.

```js
// 2) Output ("alert") the three variable values

let courseName = '100 Days Of Code - Web Development Bootcamp [2022]'
let coursePrice = 12.99
let courseGoals = ['learn HTML', 'learn CSS', 'learn JavaScript']

alert(courseName)
alert(coursePrice)
alert(courseGoals)
```

- => Now in the third task, you will need to apply more of the things we learned. I now want you to group these variables together,

```js
// 3) Try "grouping" the three variables together and still output their values thereafter

let course = {
  name: '100 Days Of Code - Web Development Bootcamp [2022]',
  price: 12.99,
  goals: ['learn HTML', 'learn CSS', 'learn JavaScript'],
}

alert(course.name)
alert(course.price)
alert(course.goals)
```

> and we did learn about a certain way of grouping related data together. So try grouping them together here,

> give them proper names, proper labels.

> And then once you did that, also still output their values. You can still use the alert function for that,

> but you will have to access your different values slightly differently than you did it before in steps one and two.

- => Now in step four and task number four, I want you to also output the second element in your main goals, variable.

```js
// 4) Also output the second element in your "main goals" variable

let course = {
  name: '100 Days Of Code - Web Development Bootcamp [2022]',
  price: 12.99,
  goals: ['learn HTML', 'learn CSS', 'learn JavaScript'],
}

alert(course.name)
alert(course.price)
alert(course.goals)
alert(course.goals[1])
```

- => Now in task number five, you should define your own command your own custom command, with any name of your choice that actually will use that main goals variable, and access and element by its identifier.

```js
// 5) Add a custom command that does the following:
//    - Use your "main goals" variable and access an element by its identifier
//    - The concrete identifier value should be dynamic / flexible
//      (i.e. the command can be executed for different identifier)
//    - The "main goals" variable should also be dynamic: The command should work
//      with ANY list of values
//    - The custom command should provide the accessed value (i.e. the list element)

let course = {
  name: '100 Days Of Code - Web Development Bootcamp [2022]',
  price: 12.99,
  goals: ['learn HTML', 'learn CSS', 'learn JavaScript'],
}

alert(course.name)
alert(course.price)
alert(course.goals)
alert(course.goals[1])

function findGoal(list, index) {
  return course.${list}[${index}]
}

myGoal = findGoal(goals, 0)
alert(myGoal)

```

> So basically what we did in task number four, but, unlike in task number four, this custom command should now be a bit more flexible.

> The concrete identifier, which you access should be dynamic, there should be some way of providing a value when that custom command is executed.

> And you should then be able to execute the same command for different identifiers.

> The main goals variable also should be dynamic inside of that command code.

> This command should not just work with main goals, but actually with any list of values.

> And last but not least, this custom command should then when you execute it, provide the accessed value, so that in the place where you did execute the custom command, you can use that accessed value. So that list element, which was retrieved by that custom command.

- => Now step number six, or task number six is to then use this custom command, which you did define in task number five and output alert the result four different values,

```js
// 6) Execute your custom command from (5) and output ("alert") the result
```

> different lists, maybe, and different identifiers of list items of your choice.

> At least executed once, but feel free to execute it more than once.

- => Now these are my tasks for you, you can put your solution code or write into this exercise JS file.

> You should just make sure that this exercise JS file is then also being used in index HTML, Maybe instead of app JS, or in addition, that's up to you.

> And definitely try this exercise on your own first.

- => In the solution video, I will show you my solution and I do recommend that you go through that video also to compare your solution,

> and also if you get stuck and you're not sure how to solve something.

> Because there I'll show you how I solved this and that will then be another great exercise, but definitely try it on your own first.

```js
// This is how a comment is added to JavaScript
// Comments are not executed - they are just there to provide extra
// information to you or other developers
