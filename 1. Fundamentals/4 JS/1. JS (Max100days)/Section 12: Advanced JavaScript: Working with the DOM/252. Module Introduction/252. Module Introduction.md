# 252. Module Introduction

```
In the previous course section, we picked up important basics about JavaScript, about the JavaScript language as a whole.
```

- => In this course section, we are now going to see why we really need JavaScript and we'll see its biggest strength and action `that we can interact with the so-called DOM`

> and you will learn what the DOM actually is in this module,

> but I can already say that this in the end will be all about `using JavaScript to select elements on the page and to manipulate elements on the page`,

> HTML elements that are displayed on the page and their styles, you can use JavaScript to change those.

- => And therefore, in this course section, we are going to explore what exactly that DOM thing is, how we can interact with it and how we can also actually listen to events

> like the user clicking somewhere or the user entering something into an input field

- => and how we can then leverage JavaScript to reach out to HTML elements that make up our website and how we can change them with JavaScript so that we can build interactive websites,

> which consists of more than just static HTML and CSS code.

> And of course, we're not just going to dive into these topics in theory, but you also will see plenty of examples in this module.

> And in this course section, we will then also be able to build this example, which I showed you in the previous course section already.

> We're going to learn everything we need for that in this section now.
