# 274. Listening To User Input Events

Now that was our first event.

- => To get a bit closer to what we actually need to do, let's add a input field next of type text maybe,

1. like this and nothing else.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Advanced JavaScript</title>
    <script src="app.js" defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Click me!</p>
    <input type="text" />
  </body>
</html>
```

> So just a basic empty input field here.

- => Now let's say we do want to listen to every keystroke and find out what the user entered, because ultimately that is what we need to do to solve this task later.

- => Now, definitely feel free to try this on your own first. Here's a quick pause for you to pause the video and give this a try. Then after, we'll do this together.

> So did you succeed? If not, that's no problem at all, because you will need to listen to an event which we haven't listened to yet. And therefore, we will now do this together.

- => First of all, we of course need to get access to this input element.

1. So here all again, add a variable and that could be my inputElement. And we can again use document querySelector and select the first and in this case, still only, input element, which we have on the screen.

```js
let paragraphElement = document.querySelector('p')

function changeParagraphText() {
  paragraphElement.textContent = 'Clicked'
  console.log('Paragraph Clicked')
}

paragraphElement.addEventListener('click', changeParagraphText)

let inputElement = document.querySelector('input')
```

- => Now, once we got hold of it, we can again add an event listener

1. by accessing our inputElement and using the addEventListener method here.

```js
let paragraphElement = document.querySelector('p')

function changeParagraphText() {
  paragraphElement.textContent = 'Clicked'
  console.log('Paragraph Clicked')
}

paragraphElement.addEventListener('click', changeParagraphText)

let inputElement = document.querySelector('input')

inputElement.addEventListener()
```

- => And now the question just is what's the name of the event we want to listen to? Now, maybe you searched for events related to key and there you find keydown, keypress and keyup.

1. The difference is basically when they occur.

- For example, keydown occurs when the key is pressed down before it's released and therefore before the input value was registered.

2. Keyup happens thereafter.

- And if you use keyup, you should be able to react to every keystroke and find out what the user did enter into the input.

- => But an even better event, which you probably did not find though is the input event,

```js
let paragraphElement = document.querySelector('p')

function changeParagraphText() {
  paragraphElement.textContent = 'Clicked'
  console.log('Paragraph Clicked')
}

paragraphElement.addEventListener('click', changeParagraphText)

let inputElement = document.querySelector('input')

inputElement.addEventListener('input')
```

1. and this essentially also reacts to keyup events, but in addition, it also picks up things like dragging and dropping a value into the input field or pasting it into the input field.

> So whenever anything is inserted into this input field, this input event will fire.

- => And therefore that is event you typically listen to when working with input elements.

- => Now we still need a function that can be executed when that event occurs.

1. So again, I'll add a function and here, I just wanna get the user input and then maybe log it to the console.

> So I'll name it, retrieveUserInput.

```js
let paragraphElement = document.querySelector('p')

function changeParagraphText() {
  paragraphElement.textContent = 'Clicked'
  console.log('Paragraph Clicked')
}

paragraphElement.addEventListener('click', changeParagraphText)

let inputElement = document.querySelector('input')

function retrieveUserInput() {}

inputElement.addEventListener('input')
```

> That could be a fitting name.

2. Now inside of this function, I wanna get access to the value the user inserted.

> So for example, I could create a variable here, inside of this function because I will only use it in there, which I'll name enteredText.

> And we can extract that from our inputElement.

```js
let paragraphElement = document.querySelector('p')

function changeParagraphText() {
  paragraphElement.textContent = 'Clicked'
  console.log('Paragraph Clicked')
}

paragraphElement.addEventListener('click', changeParagraphText)

let inputElement = document.querySelector('input')

function retrieveUserInput() {
  let enteredText = inputElement
}

inputElement.addEventListener('input')
```

> So from this variable,

- => and then the question is how do we get access to what the user entered? And that's definitely another challenge.

> If you never did that before, you can't know it, unless you may be console dot this input element

> and you had a look at the available properties there.

- => Because for input elements, to get the inserted value, you can use the value property.

1. The value property exists on input HTML element objects in JavaScript, and it holds the current value inserted into that input.

```js
let paragraphElement = document.querySelector('p')

function changeParagraphText() {
  paragraphElement.textContent = 'Clicked'
  console.log('Paragraph Clicked')
}

paragraphElement.addEventListener('click', changeParagraphText)

let inputElement = document.querySelector('input')

function retrieveUserInput() {
  let enteredText = inputElement.value
}

inputElement.addEventListener('input')
```

> So that's then my entered text.

> And then here, I'll just console log that enteredText

```js
let paragraphElement = document.querySelector('p')

function changeParagraphText() {
  paragraphElement.textContent = 'Clicked'
  console.log('Paragraph Clicked')
}

paragraphElement.addEventListener('click', changeParagraphText)

let inputElement = document.querySelector('input')

function retrieveUserInput() {
  let enteredText = inputElement.value
  console.log(enteredText)
}

inputElement.addEventListener('input')
```

> like this.

- => And now we can connect this and again, tell the browser to execute retrieveUserInput when that input event occurs.

```js
let paragraphElement = document.querySelector('p')

function changeParagraphText() {
  paragraphElement.textContent = 'Clicked'
  console.log('Paragraph Clicked')
}

paragraphElement.addEventListener('click', changeParagraphText)

let inputElement = document.querySelector('input')

function retrieveUserInput() {
  let enteredText = inputElement.value
  console.log(enteredText)
}

inputElement.addEventListener('input', retrieveUserInput)
```

> If I now save this and we go back, if I type T you'll see a T is being logged here on the right. If I type T-E we see T-E and so on.

> So the more I type, the more I see being logged here on the right, and I get this log with every keystroke I make.

- => And that is how we can listen to input events on input elements, which is another very common scenario.

> And overall you're hopefully getting a better feeling for how this event thing works.
