# 267. Next Steps

- => So let's dive into DOM manipulations. We practiced how we can select elements. Now it's time to change things on the page.

- => And of course, we did already change some things.

> For example, we changed basically an attribute value you could say by setting this href property on the anchor element.

> And in the last exercise, we changed the text content of a paragraph in that bonus task.

- => Now, these are already super important kinds of DOM manipulations because changing the text content and/or attribute values, these are amongst the most common operations you will do.

> After all, these are the things which have an impact on what you see on the screen or how certain elements behave

> like here when you change the link address.

- => But there are three other very important kinds of DOM manipulation and that would be adding a new element, deleting an existing element, or moving an existing element to a different place.

> And that's what we'll dive in next.
