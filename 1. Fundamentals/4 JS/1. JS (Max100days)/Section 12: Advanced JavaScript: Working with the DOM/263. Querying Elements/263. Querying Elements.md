# 263. Querying Elements

```
Now getElementById is one very convenient and good way of getting access to an element by a unique identifier, by its ID.

But it's not the only way of getting access to an element.
```

**querySelector()**

- => And alternative is another utility function, which you have built into JavaScript. And that's the querySelector() method, which is also part of this document object.

> So you see this document object is rather important,

1. just like getElementById, this is a method. So we execute it like this with parentheses,

```js
// document.body.children[1].children[0].href = 'https://google.com'

// console.dir(document)
// alert()
// window.alert()

let anchorElement = document.getElementById('external-link')
anchorElement.href = 'https://google.com'

document.querySelector()
```

- => but unlike ID, this does not want an ID as a parameter, but instead it wants a CSS selector.

1. So as we would have used it in CSS code As a string, but then any selector of our choice.

- => So we can use a tag selector here, a class selector or an ID selector. So I could also select this element by ID b writing this appropriate CSS ID selector, which is #external-id

```js
// document.body.children[1].children[0].href = 'https://google.com'

// console.dir(document)
// alert()
// window.alert()

let anchorElement = document.getElementById('external-link')
anchorElement.href = 'https://google.com'

document.querySelector('#external-link')
```

1. That's how we would select an element by ID in CSS. And that's the kind of parameter value querySelector wants.

> And now this will look for an element like this.

2. So here I then also again, get my anchorElement. And then here I can change this to yet another address.

> For example, to our own homepage academind.com.

```js
// document.body.children[1].children[0].href = 'https://google.com'

// console.dir(document)
// alert()
// window.alert()

let anchorElement = document.getElementById('external-link')
anchorElement.href = 'https://google.com'

anchorElement = document.querySelector('#external-link')
anchorElement.href = 'https://academind.com'
```

- => Now this is an alternative to getElementById. And when you have alternatives, the obvious question is always which alternative where which approach is better.

> Now the short answer is there is no better or worse approach you can use either of the two.

> but there is a key difference, actually.

- => getElementById as the name suggests is really focused on getting elements by ID.

> So it's a great way of getting a specific element if you added an ID to it in your HTML code, which you as the developer can always do.

- => querySelector on the other hand, wants any CSS selector. it doesn't have to be the ID selector.

1. So here I could, alternatively also select my anchor tag by not using the ID here, but the "a" CSS selector, the type selector.

```js
// document.body.children[1].children[0].href = 'https://google.com'

// console.dir(document)
// alert()
// window.alert()

let anchorElement = document.getElementById('external-link')
anchorElement.href = 'https://google.com'

anchorElement = document.querySelector('a')
anchorElement.href = 'https://academind.com'
```

> So selecting by HTML element type.

2. Just as we can write CSS rules like this,

```js
// document.body.children[1].children[0].href = 'https://google.com'

// console.dir(document)
// alert()
// window.alert()

let anchorElement = document.getElementById('external-link')
anchorElement.href = 'https://google.com'

anchorElement = document.querySelector('a') // a { color: red;}
anchorElement.href = 'https://academind.com'
```

> where we then for example, change the color of all anchor elements.

> That's what we can do in CSS. And that's what we can do with querySelector.

- => And this will then select the first, important, the first anchor element it finds on your page.

1. If you have multiple anchor elements in different places of your HTML code, querySelector will always give you the first element that matches this selector condition.

- => But it's the extra flexibility compared to getElementById that could be useful.

- => You can also have more complex selectors in here like "p a" So selecting the first anchor element that sits inside of a paragraph.

```js
// document.body.children[1].children[0].href = 'https://google.com'

// console.dir(document)
// alert()
// window.alert()

let anchorElement = document.getElementById('external-link')
anchorElement.href = 'https://google.com'

anchorElement = document.querySelector('p a') // p a { color: red;}
anchorElement.href = 'https://academind.com'
```

> Just what you can do in CSS as well, selecting anchor elements and paragraphs.

- => That's how you can do it here, (like in CSS,) with the important difference that this will always select the first matching element, not all matching elements.

- => If you want to match all elements, then you have `querySelectorAll()`. This will then not return a single element, but all matching elements.

```js
// document.body.children[1].children[0].href = 'https://google.com'

// console.dir(document)
// alert()
// window.alert()

let anchorElement = document.getElementById('external-link')
anchorElement.href = 'https://google.com'

anchorElement = document.querySelectorAll('p a') // a { color: red;}
anchorElement.href = 'https://academind.com'
```

1. So it will return an array instead of a single object.

2. Here I want a single element, so querySelector is what I want to use here.

```js
// document.body.children[1].children[0].href = 'https://google.com'

// console.dir(document)
// alert()
// window.alert()

let anchorElement = document.getElementById('external-link')
anchorElement.href = 'https://google.com'

anchorElement = document.querySelector('p a') // p a { color: red;}
anchorElement.href = 'https://academind.com'
```

- => And for the moment, that's it. It already was a lot of new knowledge with the drilling we can do with those different utility functions. But these are core mechanisms of selecting content off your page and of working with JavaScript and the dom.

1. I can only encourage you that you do play around with this console here in the dev tools to find out what's inside the body here.

> To drill into this body and use console.dir to get that object view here. So to say,

```js
console.dir(document.body)
```

2. where you can really find out which properties you have in there and how you could use these properties to navigate around between elements or to access or change their content.

> Play around with that, because we'll do that a lot throughout the course, but it definitely also won't hurt if you play around a little bit with that first.
