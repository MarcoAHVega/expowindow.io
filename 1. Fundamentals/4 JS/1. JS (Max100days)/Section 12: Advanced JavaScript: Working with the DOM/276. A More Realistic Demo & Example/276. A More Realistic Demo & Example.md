# 276. A More Realistic Demo & Example

- => So let's switch to this demo project and definitely also feel free to try it on your own first.

> Definitely feel free to try it on your own first with one important exception, you should not try to implement this color changing behavior because we're missing an important building block for that.

> But try adding the input field, maybe even the styling,

> and then also see if you can get this character account feature to work that you can calculate how many remaining characters we have if the maximum number of characters is 60,

> and then try updating this value after the input element.

- => Now, if you try this on your own, I have one important hint. You will need to find out how many characters the user already entered,

> and you will be able to do this by accessing the length property on the input value you will have retrieved at some point.

1. So .length on that input value will give you the length, the number of characters, a user entered into an input field.

```js
// Get the length of a string
let someString = 'Max'
let stringLength = someString.length
```

> Definitely, try all of that on your own.

- => I'll give you a short pause to pause the video and try it on your own and then thereafter we'll implement this together.

- => So, let's now implement this together.

1. And for this, I'll first I'll `add a new demo.js file`, which will contain the JavaScript code for this demo

2. and in index.html, I will use demo.js instead of the old-app.js file.

```js
<script src='demo.js'></script>
```

- => Now let's maybe start with the html content for that. And here I will also add some styling and so on

- and therefore, I will add a couple of extra elements here, which I will use for applying my styles here.

> Of course, there isn't a single right or wrong approach to doing this. So if you wrote some different HTML code and it looks and works correctly, that's also fine.

1. But here, I'll start by adding a form.

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>A More Realistic Demo & Example</title>
    <script src="demo.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>

    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

> Not because we'll do anything with it, but because it kind of makes sense semantically to put an input into a form, so that's well added here.

- I don't add the action or method though, because they don't really care about this right now.

2. Then in there, I'll add a little div purely for styling purposes, which will give a class of control.

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>A More Realistic Demo & Example</title>
    <script src="demo.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <div class="control"></div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

> A class, which I will use in my CSS code then to apply some styling.

3. And inside of that div I'll add a label, a label where I say Product Name,

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>A More Realistic Demo & Example</title>
    <script src="demo.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <div class="control">
        <label for="">Product Name</label>
      </div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

> because that's what we saw in this demo as well.

4. And I'll add an input of type="text," which I will also give an id="product-name" and I'll connect that label to this input as we learned it in the forms section with the for attribute.

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>A More Realistic Demo & Example</title>
    <script src="demo.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <div class="control">
        <label for="product-name">Product Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="product-name" />
      </div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

> So that semantically, the two elements are connected and screen readers, for example, know which label belongs to which input.

5. And I'll give it a name attribute as well, where I will also say "product-name."

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>A More Realistic Demo & Example</title>
    <script src="demo.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <div class="control">
        <label for="product-name">Product Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="product-name" name="product-name" />
      </div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

6. Now that's almost it, I will add one last attribute here. And that's the max length attribute.

- We learned about these validation attributes in the forms section as well. And this allows us to limit the maximum amount of characters that can be inserted into this input.

- And I'll set this to 60 here.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>A More Realistic Demo & Example</title>
    <script src="demo.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <div class="control">
        <label for="product-name">Product Name</label>
        <input type="text" id="product-name" name="product-name" maxlength="60"/>
      </div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>

> Of course, it's up to you which length you wanna choose here, but I'll go for 60.

- With that, by the way, if I save this, I got this input here and I can't type more than 60 characters. If I try to do that, it just stops. It doesn't allow me to enter more than 60.

- But of course, that extra output, which tells me the amount of remaining characters is missing. And that's why we wanna use JavaScript for that.

7. And speaking off that, after this input still inside of this div, I will add a span here. A span which then actually will contain another span.

- And in this span here, I would like to insert my remaining number of characters.

- And hence, I'll give this span an id="remaining-chars,"

- And I'll give that outer span an id="charcount"

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>A More Realistic Demo & Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <script src="demo.js" defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <div class="control">
        <label for="product-name">Product Name</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="product-name"
          name="product-name"
          maxlength="60"
        />
        <span id="charcount">
          <span id="remaining-chars">60</span>
        </span>
      </div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

> because I'll use this for styling purposes later.

8. Now the content of this inner span is currently empty, or let's say 60,

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>A More Realistic Demo & Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <script src="demo.js" defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <div class="control">
        <label for="product-name">Product Name</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="product-name"
          name="product-name"
          maxlength="60"
        />
        <span id="charcount">
          <span id="remaining-chars">60</span>
        </span>
      </div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

> because at the beginning, if nothing was typed yet, the remaining number of characters we can insert is 60 because that's our maxlength.

> That's why I'm adding 60 here as well.

9. But then they're after outside of this span, I'll also insert some plain text a slash and then 60

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>A More Realistic Demo & Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <script src="demo.js" defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <div class="control">
        <label for="product-name">Product Name</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="product-name"
          name="product-name"
          maxlength="60"
        />
        <span id="charcount"> <span id="remaining-chars">60</span>/60
      </span>
      </div>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

> to kind of signal the maximum number of characters.

- And this is not wrapped in a span because I only need to span here for the first 60 so that I can later target this through JavaScript.

> In order to get hold of that content here, that text here, that 60 here, I wanna wrap it in an element, which I can then easily select with JavaScript later so that I then later can change the text content of that element to update this remaining characters text.

> The maximum number of characters will never be updated because it will never change and hence, I don't wrap this with my span here.

10. Now last but not least, outside of this div actually, but instead of the forum, I'll add a button with a text of submit,

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>A More Realistic Demo & Example</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
    <script src="demo.js" defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <form>
      <div class="control">
        <label for="product-name">Product Name</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="product-name"
          name="product-name"
          maxlength="60"
        />
        <span id="charcount"> <span id="remaining-chars">60</span>/60
      </span>
      </div>
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
```

> but this button is only there to look good, we're not going to do anything with it at this time.

> Now this is my HTML content.

- => Now for the styling, I prepared a couple of styles and to not bore you and waste your time, you find these styles attached as style.css file is attached.

1. And I did add here drag and drop it here into my project.

2. Now definitely feel free to browse through these styles here and have a look at what I did here.

> There shouldn't be too much new content in here. These should all be CSS, rules and styles you saw before basically.

> I just have some basic styling here, some colors, some spacing that showed leads to this output here looking a bit better.

3. Now for these styles to have an effect, we need to import them though. And therefore here in my head section, let's say between the title and the script, though the exact position does not matter, I will now also link to this styles.css file

> saved as HTML file and then zoom out quite a bit here to not break this layout like this so that I can see my output here.

4. And that's now the HTML code and the CSS code with which I'll continue.

- => Now, of course, we're all here for the JavaScript code, not for the styling or the HTML code and they'll for now, we will dive into demo.js and start writing some code. And for that `let's recap what we wanna do`.

- => We wanna listen to every keystroke here in this input field,

- => then we wanna count the number of characters,

- => and then once we did that, we want to update this number here with the remaining amount of characters.

> So 60 minus the number of characters inserted here.

- => Therefore to get started, I first of all wanna `get access to the input field, and then to this span` where I wanna output the updated number of remaining characters.

1. Now the input field could be selected by id or by type with the curly selector since it's the only input field. And it's up to you, what you prefer,

- I will select the by id and get my let's say productNameInputElement,

```js
let productNameInputElement =
```

> a pretty long variable name. You can definitely also use a shorter one, but I wanna be descriptive about which exact element I'm referring to here.

2. And then in this variable, we can store the element which we get access to by using document.getElementById and then passing does ID name, product-name in my case as a parameter value to this method.

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
```

> Now, that will give us access to the input element.

3. Now to get access to the remaining chars here to this pan, we can also again use this id

- and hence I will add another variable here, the remainingCharsElement and get access with document.getElementById.

- But now the ID is that ID I have here remaining-chars So that's what I insert here.

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')
```

> Now we've got these two elements.

- => Now on that input element here, on that element, I wanna add an event listener because I wanna listen to every keystroke.

1. Hence here we can use the productNameInputElement and add an event listener as we learned it with that addEventListener method.

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

productNameInputElement.addEventListener()
```

2. Now the event I do wanna listen to here is the input event

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input')
```

> because dad will occur for every keystroke.

3. And then that second parameter value which we need to insert here, that will actually be the function that should be executed when that event occurs.

- For this, we need to add this function and the name could be updateRemainingCharacters

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

function updateRemainingCharacters() {}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input')
```

> because that's what this function ultimately will do. It will go to the dom and update the remaining characters that are displayed.

4. Now, before I add the actual code that will be executed in this function, I already wanna finish this line of code and therefore now point at this updateRemainingCharacters function here

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

function updateRemainingCharacters() {}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

> and let the browser know that this is the function that should be executed whenever that input occurs.

5. Now in this function, we now need to find out which value was inserted by the user (So which text is currently in the input element and) then how long that is.

1. Now to get access to the entered value,we got two main approaches.

- We can use this variable (productNameInputElement) and access the value property

- or alternatively, we used the event object we learned about,

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

> which also gives us access to the target of the event, which is the same input element, and we can use that to access to value.

> Both is absolutely fine.

- Here, I will use the event object.

2. And therefore here, I'll get my enteredText, (or however you wanna name this variable) by reaching out to event.target.value

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {
  let enterText = event.target.value
}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

> as we did it before.

- => Now, we need to find out how long that entered text is. We need to find out how long it is so that we can then compare it to our maximum number of characters, which is 60.

1. And therefore I'll add my enteredTextLength variable, let's say,

- which is my enteredText. And then (I mentioned it in a little hint before,) we have the length property here.

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {
  let enterText = event.target.value
  let enteredTextLength = enterText.length
}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

> Even though I'm not getting auto suggestion, because my IDE doesn't fully understand which type of value entered text will be, but we know that it will be a string and because of my hint, you know that on strings, you can actually get access to the length of that string width.length.

- As a side note on an array, if you had an array value, you also have to .length property to find out how many items are in the array.

- And when it comes to that, a string is treated a bit like an array because it's basically an array of characters, you could say.

> That's why we have to length property here.

- => With that, we know how long the enterText is, now we need to find out how many remaining characters we have.

1. And that will of course be 60 minus the current length of the entered text.

- So here maybe with an empty line in between to improve readability, I'll add a new variable which I will name remainingCharacters, and that's 60 minus enteredTextLength.

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {
  let enterText = event.target.value
  let enteredTextLength = enterText.length

  let remainingCharacters = 60 - enteredTextLength
}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

2. Now, if you wanna get really fancy and you definitely don't need to do that, but if we wanna get really fancy, instead of using 60 here, we could actually also extract the maximum amount of allowed characters dynamically from that attribute, which we set on input

- so that we don't need to hard-code as it's called the 60 here into our JavaScript code and change it whenever we changed 60 here,

- but that we instead extract the maxlength from that input element so that if we ever decide to change that allowed maxlength, we only need to do it here and here, but not also in the JavaScript code.

3. And a for that, we could add a new variable also outside of do function. It doesn't matter. We can do it outside, we can do it inside.

- I'll do it outside, which could be named maxAllowedChars.

- And here we can reach out to the productNameInputElement, which I selected here and there we'll have a maxLength property.

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

let maxAllowedChars = productNameInputElement.maxLength

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {
  let enterText = event.target.value
  let enteredTextLength = enterText.length

  let remainingCharacters = 60 - enteredTextLength
}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

> I also don't get auto suggestion here, but I know it because it's an input element object, which we have access to.

- And as always, you can console.dir your elements to have a look at them in the browser dev tools and see which properties are available.

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

//console.dir(productNameInputElement)
let maxAllowedChars = productNameInputElement.maxLength

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {
  let enterText = event.target.value
  let enteredTextLength = enterText.length

  let remainingCharacters = 60 - enteredTextLength
}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

- And there, you would see that we have such a maxLength property, which holds the maximum amount of characters that are allowed to be entered in this input element.

4. And with that, we can then use maxAllowedChars here, this variable instead of 60 down there to calculate our remaining characters.

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

//console.dir(productNameInputElement)
let maxAllowedChars = productNameInputElement.maxLength

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {
  let enterText = event.target.value
  let enteredTextLength = enterText.length

  let remainingCharacters = maxAllowedChars - enteredTextLength
}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

> I hope this makes sense.

- Now, here we are performing a mathematical operation and hence, this should give us a number in the end. It should give us the number of remaining characters that we have available.

5. And now as a very last step here in this function, we now need to update this value

```js
<span id="charcount"> <span id="remaining-chars">60</span>/60 `)
```

- with our new remaining characters number.

```js
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')
```

- And that value is the value in this span, this span here, and we already got access to this span here.

- So now we can reach out to remainingCharsElement and then set the textContent off that element to our remaining characters here, like that.

```js
let productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
let remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

//console.dir(productNameInputElement)
let maxAllowedChars = productNameInputElement.maxLength

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {
  let enterText = event.target.value
  let enteredTextLength = enterText.length

  let remainingCharacters = maxAllowedChars - enteredTextLength

  remainingCharsElement.textContent = remainingCharacters
}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

- => And that should be all we need for now. If you save that and you make sure that demo.js is linked to your index.html file, then you should now be able to reload or to go back and start typing here.

- And as you see this number after the input field updates.

- We don't have to change in color as we below 10, that's something we'll add later,

- but we get the basic functionality in place now.

- => And this applies basically everything we learned about over the last hours and we see now why we could use JavaScript

> because dynamically updating something which we see on the page and reacting to certain events that are triggered by the user, that is something we cannot do with just HTML and CSS,

> and therefore we need JavaScript to run our more complex logic, which we have here, where we count the number of characters compare that to our maxAllowedCharacters

> and then update what we see on the screen.

> That's why we use JavaScript, and here we apply a lot of the concepts we learned about over the last hours.
