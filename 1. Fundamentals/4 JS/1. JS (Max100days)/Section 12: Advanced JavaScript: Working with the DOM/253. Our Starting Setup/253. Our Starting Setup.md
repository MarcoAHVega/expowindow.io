# 253. Our Starting Setup

- => Now to get started. I am again back in an empty project and I'll do what we did many times before,

1. create a new HTML file with a basic skeleton.

2. Here, I'll say Advanced JavaScript,

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Advanced JavaScript</title>
  </head>
  <body> </body>
</html>
```

3. and I'll add a JavaScript file. I'll name it app.js

4. which I wanna import in my HTML file.

> And we did learn that this works with help of those script tags, where we can add this source attribute and then import this JavaScript file like this.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Advanced JavaScript</title>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body> </body>
</html>
```

- => Now we're ready to write more JavaScript code and therefore I'll open this site with my live server again

> so that we have this preview

- => and we will continue working with that console in the developer tools for now,

> so that I don't use alerts for outputting something, but instead this console here, which is a bit less annoying for us as a developer.

- => And with that, we got the setup we need to dive in and get started.
