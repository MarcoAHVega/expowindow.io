# 288. Using Booleans In "if" Statements (Conditional Code Execution)

- => Now that we learned about comparison operators and logical operators, here we could say that we wanna print this if the name is Max.

1. So here instead of hard coding true, we could say we wanna go in there and execute this code in the if statement if my name is equal to Max

```js
const myName = 'Max'

if (myName === 'Max') {
  console.log('Hello!')
}

// true
```

> using the triple equality operator here to also check for type.

> And if I save that, I get hello, because of course that is equal.

Now it's still kind of the same as hard coding true right in here because my name is hard coded, but again, let's just assume that this is coming from some dynamic input.

- => But now that we got this and we know basically how that works, we can go back to our demo.js file. And in there, we could now alter this function a little bit to actually add this warning clause here,

- which is defined in the CSS file, to our span and to our input, so the two elements we store here,

1. if the remaining characters here are smaller than 10.

- => Definitely try this out on your own. We'll do it together in the next lecture.

```js
const productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
const remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

//console.dir(productNameInputElement)
const maxAllowedChars = productNameInputElement.maxLength

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {
  const enterText = event.target.value
  const enteredTextLength = enterText.length

  const remainingCharacters = maxAllowedChars - enteredTextLength

  remainingCharsElement.textContent = remainingCharacters

  if (remainingCharacters <= 10) {
    productNameInputElement.classList.add('warning')
    remainingCharsElement.classList.add('warning')
  } else {
    productNameInputElement.classList.remove('warning')
    remainingCharsElement.classList.remove('warning')
  }
}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```
