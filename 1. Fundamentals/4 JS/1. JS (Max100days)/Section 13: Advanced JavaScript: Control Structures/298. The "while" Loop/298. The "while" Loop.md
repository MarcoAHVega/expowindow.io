# 298. The "while" Loop

```
Now, the last kind of loop I mentioned on the slide was a while loop.
```

- => And with the for loops, we basically always had like a fixed number of times that loop executed either because we defined it here or because we had a fixed amount of array elements or properties in an object.

- => With while loop , we instead just have a condition on which we depend. And as long as that condition is true, we continue.

Now, let me show you an example.

We write a while loop by using the while keyword, then parentheses between which we can put our condition, and then curly braces.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}

const users = ['Max', 'Anna', 'Joel']

for (const user of users) {
  console.log(user)
}

const loggedInUser = {
  name: 'Max',
  age: 32,
  isAdmin: true,
}

for (const propertyName in loggedInUser) {
  console.log(propertyName)
  console.log(loggedInUser[propertyName])
}


while () {

}
```

- => As long as the condition we put in here () is met, we'll continue executing this code.

- => So if I would write while (true) here, we would create an infinite loop and therefore for you should not saved this because this will crash your website since it will never end.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}

const users = ['Max', 'Anna', 'Joel']

for (const user of users) {
  console.log(user)
}

const loggedInUser = {
  name: 'Max',
  age: 32,
  isAdmin: true,
}

for (const propertyName in loggedInUser) {
  console.log(propertyName)
  console.log(loggedInUser[propertyName])
}

while (true) {}
```

- => Instead, we could be doing something like this. We could add a variable, "isFinished," and that could store a Boolean value, so initially it could be "false."

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}

const users = ['Max', 'Anna', 'Joel']

for (const user of users) {
  console.log(user)
}

const loggedInUser = {
  name: 'Max',
  age: 32,
  isAdmin: true,
}

for (const propertyName in loggedInUser) {
  console.log(propertyName)
  console.log(loggedInUser[propertyName])
}

let isFinished = false

while () {

}
```

- => Here in the while loop, we then check for the opposite. We want to keep on running as long as we are not finished, hence we can execute "not isFinished" here.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}

const users = ['Max', 'Anna', 'Joel']

for (const user of users) {
  console.log(user)
}

const loggedInUser = {
  name: 'Max',
  age: 32,
  isAdmin: true,
}

for (const propertyName in loggedInUser) {
  console.log(propertyName)
  console.log(loggedInUser[propertyName])
}

let isFinished = false

while (!isFinished) {}
```

- => And in here, we could now show a confirmation dialogue to the user with help of the confirm function.

- => It's basically an alternative to alert, but confirm allows us to answer with yes or no.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}

const users = ['Max', 'Anna', 'Joel']

for (const user of users) {
  console.log(user)
}

const loggedInUser = {
  name: 'Max',
  age: 32,
  isAdmin: true,
}

for (const propertyName in loggedInUser) {
  console.log(propertyName)
  console.log(loggedInUser[propertyName])
}

let isFinished = false

while (!isFinished) {
  confirm()
}
```

- => And therefore it will return a Boolean value. We can then enter the message that should be shown to the user like, "Do you want to quit?"

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}

const users = ['Max', 'Anna', 'Joel']

for (const user of users) {
  console.log(user)
}

const loggedInUser = {
  name: 'Max',
  age: 32,
  isAdmin: true,
}

for (const propertyName in loggedInUser) {
  console.log(propertyName)
  console.log(loggedInUser[propertyName])
}

let isFinished = false

while (!isFinished) {
  confirm('Do you want to quit?')
}
```

- => And this will open up an alert box, which already has a yes or no button.

- => And hence, since this will return a Boolean, we can store this in "isFinished" and override this "isFinished" variable value with the response of the user here.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}

const users = ['Max', 'Anna', 'Joel']

for (const user of users) {
  console.log(user)
}

const loggedInUser = {
  name: 'Max',
  age: 32,
  isAdmin: true,
}

for (const propertyName in loggedInUser) {
  console.log(propertyName)
  console.log(loggedInUser[propertyName])
}

let isFinished = false

while (!isFinished) {
  isFinished = confirm('Do you want to quit?')
}
```

- => And if the user chooses, "Yes," he or she wants to quit, "isFinished" will be true, and then "not true" will be false, and the while loop will quit.

- => So thereafter, we could "console.log done",

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
}

const users = ['Max', 'Anna', 'Joel']

for (const user of users) {
  console.log(user)
}

const loggedInUser = {
  name: 'Max',
  age: 32,
  isAdmin: true,
}

for (const propertyName in loggedInUser) {
  console.log(propertyName)
  console.log(loggedInUser[propertyName])
}

let isFinished = false

while (!isFinished) {
  isFinished = confirm('Do you want to quit?')
}

console.log('Done!')
```

- => but that will only execute if that while loop stops. Because as long as this keeps on executing, this code will not be executed.

So if you save that now and you reload this page, you get to this prompt, "Do you want to quit?"

And if I click on "Cancel," which means no, basically, I get this prompt again until I finally click, "Okay."

And, at that point, we get done down here and we don't get this confirmation box anymore.

And again, it's still just a dummy example, but it shows us really well how a while loop works.

And these are the key loops we have in JavaScript. Now that we explored them in theory, let's have a look at more concrete, realistic examples.
