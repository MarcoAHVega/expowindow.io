Now that we explored the fundamental basics of JavaScript that you need to know and that we also explored how we can interact with the websites that is displayed on the page with help of the DOM,

- => in this course section, we are going to stay in the JavaScript world, but we will dive into control structures,

1. which are special language features that allow us to control if certain code is executed

- => so we can implement conditional code execution and how often some code is executed

so we'll be able to execute some code repeatedly based on some condition or certain circumstances, which we, as a developer, can set.
