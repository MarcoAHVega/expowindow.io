# 289. A Real Example

- => So, were you successful? Let's do this together.

- => We want to make sure that we add this warning class here to the input and to the remainingCharacter's span if we have less than 10 remaining characters.

And with our newly gained knowledge, that's not too difficult to do.

Here we can just write "if" inside of this function here, I'm inside of this function, and here I'm writing "if".

Then you'll learned that we need parentheses and then curly braces.

Now, the code that should eventually be executed if the condition is met, goes between the curly braces, but the condition goes between those brackets here.

```js
const productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
const remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

//console.dir(productNameInputElement)
const maxAllowedChars = productNameInputElement.maxLength

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {
  const enterText = event.target.value
  const enteredTextLength = enterText.length

  const remainingCharacters = maxAllowedChars - enteredTextLength

  remainingCharsElement.textContent = remainingCharacters

  if () {

  }
}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

And the condition here is that remainingCharacters is smaller than 10 or is smaller and equal than 10.

So here we can refer to remainingCharacters, which is the number inferred with this calculation and then use the smaller or equal operator and compare it to 10.

```js
const productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
const remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

//console.dir(productNameInputElement)
const maxAllowedChars = productNameInputElement.maxLength

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {
  const enterText = event.target.value
  const enteredTextLength = enterText.length

  const remainingCharacters = maxAllowedChars - enteredTextLength

  remainingCharsElement.textContent = remainingCharacters

  if (remainingCharacters <= 10) {
  }
}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

Now, we also see how we can derive such a boolean without a hard-coded value because, of course, remaining characters will be inferred dynamically whenever this function executes which happens on every keystroke

> and remainingCharacters will be different on every keystroke.

And only if it's smaller or equal to 10, the code inside of this if block, as it's also called, will be executed.

And in here, I want to add this warning class and therefore, I can reach out to remainingCharsElement, which is this span and there use this classList object we learned about to add this warning class.

```js
const productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
const remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

//console.dir(productNameInputElement)
const maxAllowedChars = productNameInputElement.maxLength

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {
  const enterText = event.target.value
  const enteredTextLength = enterText.length

  const remainingCharacters = maxAllowedChars - enteredTextLength

  remainingCharsElement.textContent = remainingCharacters

  if (remainingCharacters <= 10) {
    remainingCharsElement.classList.add('warning')
  }
}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

And we don't just want to do that on that span here, but also on the input. So here on this productNameInputElement here, I also want to reach out to classList and add warning.

```js
const productNameInputElement = document.getElementById('product-name')
const remainingCharsElement = document.getElementById('remaining-chars')

//console.dir(productNameInputElement)
const maxAllowedChars = productNameInputElement.maxLength

function updateRemainingCharacters(event) {
  const enterText = event.target.value
  const enteredTextLength = enterText.length

  const remainingCharacters = maxAllowedChars - enteredTextLength

  remainingCharsElement.textContent = remainingCharacters

  if (remainingCharacters <= 10) {
    remainingCharsElement.classList.add('warning')
    productNameInputElement.classList.add('warning')
  }
}

productNameInputElement.addEventListener('input', updateRemainingCharacters)
```

And with that, we can save this and now in index.html, we just need to make sure that we again import demo.js,

so that we link to that script and then if you save this as well and you go back,

you will notice that as soon as we go beneath 10 characters, this turns orange here, this number, and the background of the input field

because we have that warning class added here. And also, of course, on that span.

- => Now at the moment, it never goes away if we go above 10 again, because we have no logic for that, but that's something we'll dive in next.

Here, however, we already see control structures in action and we also see why we often need them.
