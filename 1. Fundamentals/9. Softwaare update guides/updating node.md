We can verify our installation with nvm --version.

> Finally, letâ€™s use nvm to install the version we want. We can use nvm ls-remote to view all available releases.

```
nvm install [version.number] # nvm install v14.16.0
```

```
nvm ls
```

```
nvm alias default [new version number]
```

```
nvm uninstall [old version number]
```
