      ```
      git clone https://github.com/..(git clone + repo's Url)

      ```
- > once you clone the repo you have set it to a new url

      when you clone a repo and want to push it to a different github repo `you have to set a new url`
      ```
      git remote set-url origin https://github.com/..new url
      ```
      this will show where git thinks the remote repo is

      ```
      git remote -v` 
      ```
